The UK currently has a population\nof 5.5 million people aged over 75, which is set to increase to 7.1 million by 2035 [1]. Of the 3.2 million of the 5.5\nmillion people over the age of 80, half will have at least one fall a year [2]. These falls are caused due to many factors,\nincluding muscle weakness, poor balance or visual impairment [3]. With an elderly person falling every ten seconds in\nthe UK, the prevalence of life altering injuries, such as head injuries and hip fractures, is high and can prove to be fatal\n[4]. These injuries can lead to individuals requiring hospitalisation and surgery. They result in a loss of confidence and\nanxiety of falls in the future, leading to them restricting their activities in their daily lives [4] and can result in requiring\ncare home admission. This combination of physical and psychological impacts to the geriatric populations has led to\nfalls being the ninth leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in England in 2013, putting a large strain\non the National Health Service (NHS), costing £435 million annually in England alone for falls in the house [3].\nFall detection and fall prevention are two crucial strategies to reduce the prevalence of falls and allow the growing\nolder population to maintain their independence.

Pre and post fall interventions use information sources, such as walking patterns, to recognise and\nalert users of fall risks. Injury prevention are systems that detect when falls occur and minimise that may occur after the\nevent of falling. These methods reduce the frequency of falls and give people a chance to maintain their mobility.\nPeople in a care home are particularly at risk of falls. With the growing elderly population, the population of those that\nrequire care in nursing homes will increase. There are now over 400,00 people living in over 16,700 residential care\nand nursing homes in the UK [6]. A high percentage of these have cognitive impairment that may lead to a tendency to\nwander and a lack of awareness of fall risks. Maintaining their safety remains a challenge, especially throughout the\nnight when nursing staff is reduced. Therefore, effective methods for continually monitoring people remotely are a\nmust.\nSince over 65% of falls occur in the bedroom, of which 80.1% occur around the bed [7], systems that focus on people at\nrisk of falls have been developed to allow care staff to monitor movements out of the bed. These bed exiting systems\nalert care staff as to if the person is attempting to leave the bed, has gotten out of bed or has fallen [8]. The systems\ncan involve attachments to the person (e.g. garment clips) or are part of the bed (e.g. pressure-sensitive mats placed\nat the side of the bed and bedside infrared beam detectors). However, the fall risks associated with standing up are\nsimilarly present if a person rises from a chair. To produce a device that could allow care home staff to monitor if a\nperson is standing up, as sensor that could measure the postural position would be required. In this paper, a system\nthat could follow the at-risk person around their bedroom and notify care staff if they are attempting to stand up from\ntheir stationary position is proposed. This could improve patient monitoring and allow for care staff to differentiate the\ncurrent fall risk of the user.\nFigure 1: PPG based postural movement detection methodology\nTo achieve the detection of the individuals standing up, a wearable sensor detection of the movement would be required.\nA non-invasive, low-cost sensor that can be utilised for detecting movement is Photoplethysmography (PPG). PPG is an\noptical method for detecting changes in blood volume as a person moves [9]. As the person stands up, orthostatic stress\ncauses a sudden increase in blood volume, differing in magnitude depending on the age and health of the individual and\nthe type of postural change [10]. Signal analysis, segmentation, and feature extraction of PPG signals found during\nmovement could enable a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm to classify the changes in blood volume. This process\nallows for the automatic recognition of postural movement. Other Human Activity Recognition (HAR) [11, 12, 13]\nsystems have used ML for recognising movement patterns in PPG signal. However, these studies have been employed\nfor recognition of ambulatory movements, such as walking and jogging. There are no known examples in the literature\nof techniques proposed for postural movement recognition for a standalone PPG sensor.\n2\n\nML Assisted Postural Movement Detection using PPG\nThis paper is structured as follows. Section 2 give a background description on PPG, ML and HAR, as well as their\ncurrent related work. Section 3 discusses the approach taken for this project, as seen in Figure 1, for the device design,\nsignal processing and ML. Finally, the results of the ML training and testing are presented in section 4 and section 5 is\nthe discussion of the results and the project.\n2\nBackground and Related Work\nThis section provides a comprehensive overview of PPG signals, highlighting their characteristics and applications in\nmonitoring human activities and other related uses.\n2.1\nPhotoplethysmography\nFigure 2: Principles of the PPG signal [15]\nPhotoplethysmography is an optical method for measuring pulsatile\nblood volume in the microvascular bed of tissue [9]. The method\ninvolves the use of a light emitting source, such as an LED, to radiate\nlight onto tissue, such as the skin. A photodetector measures the\nlight that has been reflected from or transmitted through the tissue.\nThe blood volume changes are induced by the pressure pulse of\neach cardiac cycle [14], effecting the received light intensity at the\nphotodetector [15]. Figure 2 illustrates the standard composition of a\nPPG waveform. The waveform can be split into two sections. These\nare the AC component, which represents the pulsatile component of\nthe blood, and the DC component, which relates to the average blood\nvolume of the tissue [9]. The DC component changes slowly due to\nfactors such as respiration and blood vessel vasoconstrictor waves.\nEach PPG pulse begins with a sharp increase in blood being pumped\ninto the tissue. Chen et al [16] proposed a time domain analysis\nmethod for determining the pulse onset, utilising a moving average\nfilter to create a baseline. The onset was determined by filtering out PPG values above the baseline, removing the\ndetection of false peaks. The Points-Of-Interest (POI) that can be found from the AC component include the systolic\npeak, dicrotic notch and the diastolic peak . The systolic peak marks the largest amount of blood found in the tissue.\nThe amplitude of the pulse then decreases into a local minimum, called the dicrotic notch, indicating the closure of the\naortic valves [17]. The signal found between the onset of the pulse and the dicrotic notch is referred to as the systolic\nphase and the signal after the notch till the end of the wave and onset of the consecutive pulse is called the diastolic\nphase. An additional peak can be found after the dicrotic notch, called the diastolic peak. The shape of the waveform\ncan differ greatly between individuals, due to factors such as age and exercise [18].\nFigure 3: PPG pulse points of interest and features\nThe wavelengths of the light of the LEDs are selected depend-\ning on the purpose for the sensor and the placement of the\nsensor on the body. The wavelengths of the light of the LEDs\nare selected depending on the types of measurements that are\ncompleted by the device. The largest components of the up-\nper layers of tissue that affect the rates of absorption of light\nare water, haemoglobin and tissue depth [9], [15]. Water is\na major component of the skin and is highly absorbent to ul-\ntraviolet and higher frequency light signals, whereas lower\nfrequency and Infra-Red (IR) signals are in a window of the\nabsorption spectra, allowing for higher penetration of light into\nthe microvascular bed of tissue. Oxygenated and deoxygenated\nHaemoglobin have significant different absorption rates, expect\nat wavelengths close to infra-red, meaning that green LEDs are\ncommonly used for oxygen measurements [19]. To maximise light penetration and PPG received intensities, green\nand blue LEDs should be used for wrist applications, whereas lower frequency light, such as red, should be used for\nforehead applications [20]. Skin temperature also has a quantitative effect on the signal quality, as lower temperatures\nreduces perfusion rates in the vascular bed, as the body attempts to conserve body heat, constricting blood vessels\nand increasing the distance the light has to travel [15]. The PPG sensor contact pressure (CP), which is the external\npressure applied by the sensor on the surface of the skin, further impacts the PPG readings [21]. The amplitude and\nshape of the PPG waveform are impacted, with higher contact pressures increasing the accuracy of physiological\nmeasurements, such as the heart rate[18].Transmission mode detectors are commonly used for PPG sensors placed\n3\n\nML Assisted Postural Movement Detection using PPG\nat the ear or finger. Reflection mode sensor allow for a higher level of flexibility, such that they are more suitable for\nwearable devices, and are used in ankle, chest, forearm, forehead and wrist applications [19]. Research has also been\ndone for multi-wavelength PPG sensors [15], where using combinations of IR, red and green LEDs are used in close\nproximity to each other and around 2mm from the photodiode.\nThe site of the sensor on the body is an important consideration for the mode, wavelength and sensor used and can\nlead to different morphology of the waveform. The sites that are primarily used are the ankle, chest, earlobe, forearm,\nforehead, finger and upper wrist. A large number of the consumer devices use wrist applications [18], [19], as it is\nconvenient to wear, highly portable and can be combined in smart watches. The upper wrist has been found to have\nrelatively low signal amplitude in comparison to other sites [19] and a higher susceptibility to Motion Artifacts (MA).\nAnother key placement of the PPG sensor is the ear lobe, as the lack of cartilage and thus contain a large volume of\nblood, creating a suitable site for transmission type sensors. However, their usage can become uncomfortable after\nlong monitoring periods [22]. The finger is a common location for pulse oximetry [23] as either a clip or ring. The\nforehead is suited for reflective mode sensor, as the thin skin, high density of blood vessels and skull give a powerful\noptical signal. The forearm can be used for arterial PPG measurements, but has been found to have a lower pulse\namplitude than wrist or finger sensors [22]. From the PPG waveform, pulse time domain analysis can be completed to\nextract features of the signal [9], [24]. From the POI from each of the pulses of the wave, as discussed earlier, extracted\nfeatures, such as the pulse width, systolic and diastolic amplitudes, pulse offset, and peak difference can be found.\nFigure 3 illustrates the correlation between the extracted features and the POI.\nThe pulse width is described as the time difference between the onset of two consecutive pulses. The systolic amplitude\nis defined as the difference between the height of the systolic peak and the pulse onset, while the diastolic amplitude\nis the difference in height between the diastolic peak and the start point. The difference in magnitude between the\npulse onset and end point is defined as the pulse offset. The peak difference is the difference in systolic and diastolic\nmagnitudes.\nFurther features of the PPG waveform can be extracted from the first and second derivatives of the waveform [18], [19],\n[25]. The first derivative can be used for reliable detection of the diastolic peak, while the second derivative can be\nused for detection of the dicrotic notch [17]. The features of the second derivative can be used for diagnosis of cardiac\nabnormalities [19], such as arterial stiffness and arterial aging. Further features can be found when combining the\nPPG sensor with an ECG device, such as the Pulse-Transit-Time (PTT) and the Pulse-Wave-Velocity (PWV). PTT is\ndefined as the time between the R-peak of the ECG to the onset of the PPG wave. The PPT can also be derived from\nPPG signals from two sensor placed at different sites on the body [17]. The PWV is defined as the inverse of the time\nbetween the R-peak in the ECG to the peak in the first derivative of the PPG signal. Furthermore, frequency domain\nanalysis can be utilised for stationary processes, but should not be used for monitoring the morphology of the pulse due\nto movement [10].\nTo give confidence in the accuracy of the physiological measurements made by a PPG device, reproducibility is an\nimportant metric in the development of the sensor. For continuous monitoring, PPG waveform noise can reduce the\naccuracy and reproducibility of the measurement system. The characteristics of the noise that can affect the PPG\nanalysis are Motion Artifacts (MA), baseline wandering and hypoperfusion [9], [17]. Figure 4 illustrates the three PPG\ndistortions.\nFigure 4: Examples of distortions in the PPG\nsignal due to motion artifacts, baseline wander-\ning and hypoperfusion [15]\nAs changes in the body movements occur, such as hand movements\nor walking, the volume of blood adjusts. These sudden changes in\nthe blood can create distortions in the PPG waveform, called Motion\nartifacts [17]. If the body part in which PPG is placed on moves\nduring measurements, the relative movement between the PPG LED\nand photoreceptor, as well as the movement of the skin in contact with\nthe sensor, can also cause distortions in the waveform [11]. Baseline\nwandering is noise due to changes in the baseline of the pulsatile\ncomponent and the AC amplitude of the PPG signal [17]. Respiration,\nsympathetic nervous system activities and thermoregulation are all\nfactors that can move the baseline [17], interfering with the analysis\nof the AC component of the PPG. Hypoperfusion is a reduction in\nthe changes of blood volume in the blood vessels due to factors such\nas hypothermia and vasoconstriction [17].\nFrom the features extracted from the waveform, PPG allows for the\ndetection of cardiovascular and respiratory physiological parameters.\nBlood Oxygen Saturation; Heart Rate; Pulse Rate Variability; Blood\npressure; Respiration Rate; Arterial stiffness.\n4\n\nML Assisted Postural Movement Detection using PPG\nUsing these physiological parameters, doctors can diagnose a wide range of clinical conditions. Benefits of the use of\nPPG lies in the non-invasive measurements and the convenience of wearable devices for the assessment of vascular\nand autonomic function [9], [18]. One of the early uses for PPG was to determine the SPO2 for individuals under\nanaesthesia [23]. The derivatives of the PPG signal can be used to determine the cardiovascular mortality [23], allowing\nfor the identification of the individuals at risk of cardiovascular diseases. PPG devices are used as part of an overnight\ntest to help diagnose sleep disorders, including Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) [23]. By observing changes in the\nSPO2 and changes of the PPG signal with respiration are often utilised for diagnosis [18]. Other conditions include\ndetection of atrial fibrillation, monitoring the spread of infectious diseases, blood sugar monitoring for diabetics and\nneurological diagnosis and treatment [9], [18], [23].\nWhen a person stands up, changes in the blood flow in the microvascular blood vessels occurs. When a person rises,\northostatic stress occurs, where blood is forced to the lower extremities and pools in the peripheral veins [10].This\nchange in blood volume causes a drop in blood pressure and reduced cardiac output. When this occurs, baroreceptors in\nthe arteries will detect the change in blood pressure and will initiate a baroreflex response. This response will increase\nheart rate and constrict the venous system to the peripheral arterioles. This reflex restores the blood pressure back to a\nnominal value. Conditions, such as Orthostatic Hypotension (OH), defined as a BP drop of at least 20 mm Hg systolic\nand/or >10 mm Hg diastolic 3 minutes after postural change [26], can effect the magnitude of the blood pressure drop\nand the time it takes for the blood pressure to return to nominal values [27]. OH is prevalent in older adults and has a\nhigh associating with falls [26].\n2.2\nMachine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) is a tool that is used widely for fall identification and prevention, where activities such as falling\nforwards, falling backwards and spinning can be differentiated from non-fall activities [4]. ML is a learning ability\nfor a system to observe trends in data. The steps required for the development of ML involves data collection, data\nprocessing, feature extraction, training the ML algorithms and performance evaluation. For PPG, the raw data gathered\nfrom the sensor is noisy and processing techniques can be used to clean the signal. Feature selection is an important\nstep that can influence the classification accuracy of the models and can reduce the processing costs in model training\n[4]. A large number of features can lead to overfitting of the model [4], reducing the effectiveness of the model in\npredicting unseen data and reducing the testing accuracy performance. Therefore, assessment of the importance of\npredictors and the removal of redundant features is an essential step. Machine learning can be categorised as non-deep\nlearning or deep learning methods [11]. Non-deep learning approaches include Random Forest (RF), decision tree,\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN). Deep learning approaches include Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).\nThis can be done Following feature extraction from PPG signals, the data is partitioned into training and testing sets,\nwith the ratio determined by system design considerations. The training data is utilised by the ML algorithm to discern\ndata patterns, such as fall activities for fall prevention recognition techniques. The testing data is used to evaluate the\nperformance of the algorithm, using accuracy, sensitivity and specificity metrics.\nML has found a wide array of applications in the analysis and interpretation of PPG signals. It facilitates the automatic\ndetection of physiological parameters including HR [28], BP [29], [30] and blood glucose [30].Goh et al described a\ndeep learning approach for the automatic detection of MA in PPG signals [31], allowing for the automatic cleaning of\nPPG signals for physiological measurements. Alkhodari et al utilised ML for the recognition of cardiovascular risk\nfactors [32]. The ML algorithms for PPG analysis in this project are as follows:\nDiscriminant Analysis (DA):\nDiscriminant analysis is a technique used mainly in the transformation of high-\ndimensional data into a lower dimensional format[4], thereby maximising the class separability [33]. Discriminant\nanalysis is a good model for prediction of wide datasets. The most popular approach is for Linear Discriminant Analysis\n(LDA) [4], where linear boundaries between classes are found, while quadratic discriminant analysis finds non-linear\nseparations.\nNaive Bayes (NB):\nThe Naïve Bayes utilises the Bayes Theorem to construct classes based on probability [4]. The\nalgorithm determines the probability of each class in the training data and the likelihood of observing features from a\ntest dataset for a given class. The Bayes theorem combines these values to determines the probability of the different\npossible classes for the test dataset. The class of the highest probability is chosen as the predicted class. This is a\npopular method used to provide fast predictive results.\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM):\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model that\nattempts to find a hyperplane that can divide classes of data, such that there is an equal distance between classes to the\n5\n\nML Assisted Postural Movement Detection using PPG\nhyperplane [4]. The algorithm attempts to find the optimal hyperplane to maximise the margin between data, so that\nthe hyperplane acts as a decision boundary between classes [4]. The shapes of the hyperplanes can either be linear or\nnon-linear. The linear classifier finds boundaries between linearly isolated data points[4] and the non-linear classifier\nfinds hyperplanes between more complex class boundaries. The performance of SVM depends on the magnitude of the\nseparation between classes [34]. Therefore, in cases where class boundaries overlap, the accuracy of the model reduces.\nDecision tree (DT):\nDecision tree (DT) models are structured as a series of decision trees [30]. Each decision tree\nconsists of nodes, representing a test, with branches sprouting from each node, representing the outcomes of the test.\nThe classifier is built based on the path that the algorithm takes through the tree. DTs are very sensitive to training data,\nwhere small changes in the training data can affect the overall tree structure [30].\nK-Nearest Neighbours (KNN):\nK-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for\nboth classification and regression models [4]. This algorithm assumes that points of the same class are found in close\nproximity to each other. The first step of the algorithm is to determine the distance between the training data to the new\ndata point that the algorithm is attempting to classify. The test points are then ranked based on their proximity to the\nnew data point. The first k number of neighbours closest to the new data point are found and the algorithm determines\nthe average class of these neighbours. The algorithm then assigns the most common class identifier to the new data\npoint.\nArtificial Neural Network (ANN):\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a ML algorithm inspired by neurology in\nthe human brain [4]. ANNs are made up of processing elements, referred to as neurons, which are connected together\nand are organised into layers [35]. Each of these connections has a weight, determining the strength of the connection.\nANN utilises an activation function to translate a set of inputs, known as the input layer, to a set of outputs, known as\nthe output layer. The activation function takes the sum of each input after multiplying them with their respective weight.\nCommon activation functions include sigmoid, Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), and the hyperbolic tangent (tanh). ANN\ncan also have hidden layers between the input and output layers to cope with nonlinearly separable problem [35]. For\nhidden layers, the output of a ANN signal can be used as an input for a consecutive ANN.\nThe training of the ANN comes in the adjustments of the weights. For each input, a trainer is used to predict the input\nand create a cost function for each layer, finding the difference between the predicted and actual values. ANN repeats\nthe training process and adjusts the weights to reduce the difference between the predicted and actual values. The result\nis a system that can take input data and create a prediction, based on the patterns learned during training.\n2.3\nHuman Activity Recognition\nSmart watches, phone movement and other wearable sensors are used for recognition of various human activities,\nsuch as jogging and running [11]. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is used in health care, skills assessments and\nsurveillance [12]. There are a number of types of sensors used for HAR, chosen depending on factors such as the\ntargeted activities, costs and form factor [11]. The most popular sensor is the tri-axial accelerometers, which can be\nfound in many smartphones and smart watches [4], [11]. Chou et al [36] proposed a bed exiting alarm system that\nutilised a singular accelerometer placed on the chest that monitored the tilt angle of the upper body. For posture related\ntasks, waist and thigh accelerometer combinations allow for the greatest accuracy [37]. Accelerometers, as well as other\ntypes of inertial sensors, can also be used in conjunction with PPG sensor for effective tracking of movement actions\n[13] and as a reference signal, utilised in the cancellation of MA in the PPG signal [24]. The advantage of using PPG\nover accelerometers is the lower power consumption [11] and the ability to computing HAR while measuring other\nphysiological parameters, such as the heart rate [11], [12]. This allows for the reduction in resources while sensing.\nML have proven to be a successful approach for HAR. For fall prevention, studies involving SVM have been the\nmost popular [4]. This is due to SVMs ability to detect distinct datasets, with the differences between the data of a\nstanding and fallen person creating a wide margin around the hyperplane. For PPG signal HAR using ML, Mehrang et\nal [34] used Randon Forest (RF) and SVM algorithms for a PPG and accelerometer combination study to detect sitting,\nhousehold activity and low and high intensity cycling. This approach resulted in 89.2% and 85.6% average recognition\naccuracies for the RF and SVM classifiers, respectively. Various deep learning approaches have been utilised for HAR\nusing PPG data. Alessandrini et al [12] utilised a RNN for the detection of resting, squatting and stepper activities\nutilising a PPG and accelerometer combination data set. Hnoohom et al [38] produced a deep learning approach with\nan F1 score of 90% for various exercise and movement activities. For standalone PPG recordings, CNN [31] and DNN\n[11] approaches for various ambulatory activities have also achieved high levels of accuracy.\n6\n\nML Assisted Postural Movement Detection using PPG\n3\nMethod ana Analysis\nThe methodology adopted in this work is illustrated in Figure 1. It encompasses three primary stages: hardware/software\ndevelopment, signal processing, and machine learning. A detailed discussion of each stage is provided in this section.\n3.1\nHardware Design\nFigure 5: PPG Datacollection Wearable\nTo monitor the PPG signal from an individual during movement, the de-\nvice depicted in Figure 5 was developed. The design emphasized simplicity,\nreliable data readings, wearability, and wireless capabilities. To ensure flex-\nibility in modifying the design and to streamline the development process, the\nelectronics are modular, and development kits were used where possible to\ndemonstrate the concept. The MAX30101 [39] , an integrated pulse oximetry\nand heart-rate monitor module, was chosen as the sensor. The microcontroller\nfor this design was selected to support peripheral interfaces for sensor inter-\naction, have low power consumption for use with a small battery, and provide\nwireless connectivity. The ESP32-DevKitC V4 (ESP32) [41] was selected\nfor this purpose. It uses the ESP32-WROOM-32 MCU module to control\nthe sensor’s operation and includes the I²C peripheral for interfacing with\nthe MAX30101. Both the sensor and the microcontroller is powered by a\nbattery and the entire system is stored in a 3D printed housing. Integrating\nthe sensors and the processor into a single chip could reduce the size of wearable by approximately 50%. However, the\nprimary focus of this study is to explore feasibility, so the size of the wearable was not a major consideration.\nTo gather PPG sensory data and to transmit the data to a computer, firmware for the ESP32 and a software program\non the computer were developed. The firmware involved establishing a connection to the MAX30101 and a wireless\nconnection to the computer. The software on the computer received the data from the device and securely stored it onto\nthe device. A TCP connection was chosen, as it allowed for remote connectivity to the device and reliable delivery of\nthe sensory and time data. The TCP client and TCP server were found on a computer and the device respectively.\n3.2\nSoftware Design\nThe software for the ESP32, programmed in C, was designed for two tasks: sensory data acquisition and TCP\ncommunication. The former involved establishing the I²C connection between the MAX30101 sensor and the ESP32\nand reading PPG data from the red LED. The latter established the TCP server on the device and transmitted the PPG\ndata and the time for each recording over the connection. The Arduino Wi-Fi [42] and Wire [43] and the SparkFun\nMAX30101 [44] sensor libraries were used for this code Figure 6 illustrates the firmware on the ESP32. To activate the\nFigure 6: Flow chart for the device software (device.ino)\nsetup of the device, the device needed to be powered and the enable button on the ESP32 had to be pressed. The Wi-Fi\nconnection to device was then established, thus allowing for the creation of the TCP server on the device. The program\nthen checked if there was an I²C connection between the pins of the MAX30101 and the ESP32. Upon confirmation of\na connection, the parameters for the MAX30101 were set. Upon completion of the setup, the loop code was initialised.\n7\n\nML Assisted Postural Movement Detection using PPG\nFigure 7: Flow chart for the receiver software (recciever.py)\nThe establishment of the TCP client object in the loop allowed for the device to check for client connections to the\nserver. The program would then go into a nested while loop, where it continually checks that the connection has\nbeen maintained and that less than a minute of recording has taken place, otherwise closing the connection. If these\nconditions have been met, then the ESP32 will ask the MAX30101 to produce new data and will transmit the PPG\nsensory data and the time data, once they have become available. For the client to be able to differentiate the data type\nbeing transmitted, the Most Significant Bit (MSB) of the data point is set as either high for time data, or low for sensory\ndata. The sensor and time data are transmitted as a continuous stream of 32-bit integers to the client and are separated\nthrough the use of a comma.\nThe client side of the TCP connection is a Python program that runs on a computer and utilises Socket python library\n[45]. Figure 7 shows the structure of the code. The initial step created a “socket” TCP client object and attempted to\nconnect this to the ESP32 TCP server. This will then begin a while loop that will receive data from the device until the\ntimer on the ESP32 reaches 1 minute and closes the connection. Once connected, the client will read the data received\nfrom the device and decodes the packets into individual data points. The processing involves removing the MSB of the\nreceived data, indicating the data type, and storing the remaining data. The error flagging allows for the realignment of\nerroneous received data that were fragmented during the read process. If no information is being transmitted from the\ndevice, primarily due to the recording being completed, then the computer will disconnect the client to the server and\nwill store the gathered data as a .m file.\nFigure 8: Examples of the raw and filtered PPG signals for the postural movements\n8\n\nML Assisted Postural Movement Detection using PPG\n3.3\nData Collection\nParticipants were recruited to take part in a controlled postural movement recognition experiment. Participants were\nasked to perform two activities. These movements included:\n1. Sitting stationary on a chair to move into a standing position.\n2. Lying flat on the ground to move into a standing position.\nThe initial step was for the participant to place the device onto their temple (other locations). Adjustments were made\nto the position of the device to ensure a good contact pressure between the device and the skin. An initial test recording\nwas done to make sure that an expected PPG value was being read, confirming the correct placement of the device. The\nparticipant was then asked to remain in the initial stationary position for a period of 30 seconds, maintaining a regular\nbreathing pattern and without moving or talking. At 29 seconds, an indication that the 30 second point was approaching\nwas giving and at 30 seconds, the participant was asked to stand. They remained for a period of 30 seconds in the\nstanding position.\n11 participants were recruited for the study. The device was used to record the PPG signal whilst participants moved\nfrom sitting-to-standing and lying-to-standing. This generated a total of 2460 seconds of labelled data. Of the 41\nrecordings, 24 were for sitting-to-standing transitions and the remaining were for lying-to-standing transitions. Improper\nplacement of the sensor, movement of the sensor as the participant moved into the standing position and movement\nduring the stationary phases of the recordings created errors which meant that 3 of the recordings were not used in the\ndata.\nFigure 8 illustrates the differences that can be found between the three classes. Between the postural movements changes\nto the signal due to the movement can be observed. For the sitting-to-standing and lying-to-standing movements, an\nincrease in blood volume after the movement at 30 seconds and subsequently dropped at 40 seconds. Between the\nthree movements shown in Figure 8, the standard deviations of the systolic peaks of the stationary, sitting-to-standing\nand lying-to-standing are ±160.6, ±429.7 and ±1100.7 respectively. The greater variability of the raw signal with\nmovements indicates that there is an increasing variability in the blood volume changes, with the largest changes\noccurring with lying-to-standing movements.\nFigure 9: PPG signal processing a lying position to a standing position (a) Raw signal, (b) Detrended signal, (c) Filtered\nsignal, (d) Filtered PPG pulses.\nFor the filtered waveforms, the changes from the stationary signal pattern were primarily during the initial movement.\nAdditionally, the increase in blood volume is indicated by a decrease in the systolic and diastolic amplitudes, fluctuating\ndepending on the gradient of the blood volume changes. Further differentiation between the sitting-to-standing and\nlying-to-standing movements can be seen in the larger amplitudes of the initial MA for the lying-to-standing movement.\n3.4\nSignal Processing\n9\n\nML Assisted Postural Movement Detection using PPG\nFigure 10: Example of pulse onset detection of the PPG\nsignal\nFigure 11: Diastolic peak detection, displaying the match-\ning of the second derivative minima to the zero crossing\npoints in the first derivative\nFor each recording of a participant’s postural movements,\nthe PPG information was obtained by an algorithm devel-\noped in MATLAB. The program processed the raw data into\ndifferent formats, filtered unwanted noise and segmented\nthe signal into individual PPG pulses. Each pulse then had\nthe POI and features determined.\nTo ensure that accurate results could be collected from\nthe PPG wave, the raw signal was pre-processed before\nfeature extraction. To remove erroneous data that may be\npresent in the time and sensor data, results out with the\nexpected ranges from the data were removed. Figure 9\nshows an example of a transition from a lying position to\na standing position. To isolate the MA aspects of the wave,\nthe MATLAB ‘detrend’ function and a bandpass filter is\napplied to the PPG wave. The detrend function removes\nthe linear trends and DC component of the signal. For\nthe filter, a normalised start frequency 0.0075 Hz/sample\nand a stop frequency of 0.2 Hz/sample. The removal of\nthe higher frequency aspects of the PPG waveform reduce\nnoise and the likelihood of false peaks. The removal of the\nlow frequency components removes the effects of baseline\nwandering. The affect of the filter can be seen in Figure 9(c),\nwhere the PPG signal magnitudes are normalised around\nzero.\nFor the analysis of the waveform, the PPG signal was seg-\nmented into individual pulses. This was completed by identifying the pulse onsets and storing the waveforms found\nbetween these values. To identify the pulse onset, the minima of the PPG wave were identified. To improve the\nreliability and precision of the identification of the true pulse onsets, the process illustrated in Figure 10 was used. A\ncentre moving average filter was used to calculate a baseline of the PPG waveform. To remove falls onsets, the minima\nof the wave were selected if the distance between minima was larger than half the period of the signal pulses and if the\nminima could be found below the baseline. This eliminated dicrotic notches being misidentified as the onset of the\npulses.\nFor each of the pulses of the PPG signal, the POI were identified. For the filtered PPG signal, the POI found seen in\nFigure 3 were found. This included the magnitudes and times for the onset of the pulse, the end point, the systolic\npoint, the diastolic point and the dicrotic notch. These points were also identified for each of the pulses in the raw and\ndetrended PPG signals. The onset and ending points were determined using the minima located during the segmentation\nprocess. The systolic point was identified by finding the maximum peak of the pulse. Figure 11 shows the detection\nprocess for the diastolic peak.\nThe initial step was to determine the minima of the second derivative and the zero crossing points of the first derivative.\nTo determine the diastolic peak, where a minima of the second derivative had the same time value as the right most\nzero crossing point, excluding the ending of the pulse. If a match cannot be found, the location of the right most zero\ncrossing point is used. This increased the reliability of detecting the diastolic point, as the shallow gradient of the pulse\ncan peak identification errors when utilising regular peak detection.\n3.5\nFeature Selection and Extraction\nTo visualize the importance of the features for the removal of redundant predictors, the Chi-square test algorithm was\nutilized [38]. The Chi-squared test performs a statistical hypothesis test and determines the differences between the\nobserved and expected frequencies of samples within the data. The relevance’s of the features were then ranked. Figure\n12 shows the chi-squared test importance values for each of the 21 features gathered. The features that had the highest\nassociations to the target variables were the systolic magnitude, systolic rise gradient and raw systolic amplitude. The\nfeatures that had the least significance for the classifier were the detrended diastolic amplitude, diastolic magnitude and\nthe dicrotic magnitude. The low number of features meant that a reduction of a single feature could affect the overall\nperformance of the algorithm training, so only features that had little importance were removed. Therefore, the dicrotic\nmagnitude was removed.\n10\n\nML Assisted Postural Movement Detection using PPG\nTable 1: Chi-squared test features in order of importance\nFeature index\nFeature\n1\nSystolic magnitude\n2\nSystolic rise gradient\n3\nRaw systolic amplitude\n4\nsystolic amplitude\n5\nSystolic and diastolic peak difference\n6\nDetrended systolic amplitude\n7\nPulse onset magnitude\n8\nRaw offset\n9\nRaw orthostatic magnitude\n10\nPulse Width\n11\nEnd point magnitude\n12\nDetrended offset\n13\nDiastolic amplitude\n14\nRaw diastolic amplitude\n15\nSystolic phase\n16\nDiastolic phase\n17\nOffset\n18\nDetrended orthostatic magnitude\n19\ndetrended diastolic amplitude\n20\ndiastolic magnitude\n21\ndicrotic magnitude\nFigure 12: Chi-squared test feature selection importances.\nThe features can be found in Table 1.\nFor the detection of the differences in PPG signals from\nindividual segments, a set of features capable of discrimi-\nnating between movement types is essential. These features\nwere extracted from the POI determined for both the raw,\ndetrended and filtered pulses of the PPG signal. The analy-\nsis done was completed using time domain analysis, as this\nallowed for the observation of changes in the morphology\nin the PPG pulses.\nFor each of the pulses, the POI can be used to derive a\nvariety of features. The features found in Figure 3, such\nas the pulse width, the systolic and diastolic amplitudes,\nthe systolic and diastolic phases and the offset. Further-\nmore, the peak difference between the systolic and diastolic\npoints, referred to as the PPG peak difference, and the gradient of the systolic rise were determined. Similar features\nwere extracted from the detrended and raw PPG signals.\nFigure 13: Example of the orthostatic magnitude for a\nlying-to-standing PPG signal.\nAdditionally, another feature was extracted to measure the\neffect of the orthostatic stress. As seen in Figure 13, large\nchanges in the systolic magnitudes of the raw signal be-\ntween the PPG values at rest compared to the values after\nthe movement. To quantify this, a feature called the ortho-\nstatic magnitude was found. A baseline value from when\nthe wearer was stationary in either the sitting or lying posi-\ntions was determined. The orthostatic magnitude is defined\nas the difference in height between the systolic peak and\nthe baseline value. The orthostatic magnitude was found\nfor both the raw and detrended signals.\nThe MATLAB classification learner app was utilised to\ntrain and analyse a variety of ML algorithms. A table\ncontaining the extracted features from the PPG data, where\nthe type of movement is labelled, is input into the toolbox.\nThe algorithms were implemented using several preset hyperparameter configurations. The data set was split a training\n11\n\nML Assisted Postural Movement Detection using PPG\nset and a test set into a 9:1 ratio. A cross-validation strategy was applied to create divisions in the data, where k folds in\nthe dataset are trained in the model k times, reducing the effects of overfitting. The cross-validation process split the\ndataset into 10 separate folds.\n3.6\nMachine Learning results\nThe performance of the ML models were evaluated with three metrics, accuracy, precision, sensitivity and the F1 score\nfor each activity[38]. The definitions for the above metrics are defined as below:\nAccuracy(%) =\nTP + TN\nTP + FP + FN + TN × 100\n(1)\nPrecision(%) =\nTP\nTP + FP × 100\n(2)\nWhere:\n• True Positive (TP): The number of segments that are correctly classified the movement.\n• True Negative (TN): The number of segments where the movement is correctly rejected.\n• False Positive (FP): The number of segments incorrectly classified the movement, when it was another class.\n• False Negative (FN): The number of segments where the classifier failed to predict the correct movement.\nFigure 14: F1 scores for the wide ANN\nThe results for these metrics for ML algorithm configurations can be\nfound in Table 2. The accuracy score is a representation of the overall\naccuracy of the model in correctly predicting the correct movement\nfor the 3 classes. The average validation and test accuracy values\nfor all the ML models used was 81.4% and 77.7% respectively. For\nthe recognition of the types of movements, all the algorithms had\nthe best performance at detecting if the individual was stationary,\nwith an average F1 score of 88.8%. This greatly differs from the F1\nscores of the sitting-to-standing and the lying-to-standing transitions\nof 38.7% and 57.1% respectively. Between algorithms, there were\nsizable differences between the correct recognition of movements.\nThe standard deviations between the average values of the F1 scores\nfor each algorithm are ±3.4%, ±16% and ±16.8% for the three classes.\nThis indicates that there is a greater spread in the recognition accura-\ncies of for the sitting-to-standing and the lying-to-standing transitions.\nThis can be attributed to some of the algorithms failing to detect\npostural movements, such as the coarse DT and coarse KNN failing\nto detect the sitting-to-standing movements.\nThe algorithms with the highest performing accuracy scores were KNN, with an average test accuracy of 81.1%, and\nANN, with a average test accuracy of 81.6%. These algorithms had the highest F1 scores, with ANN having a much\nbetter performance than KNN for the detection of the sitting-to-standing transition. This disparity meant that ANN had\na better overall recognition performance in comparison to KNN, with an average F1 score of 6% higher than KNN.\nThe three best performing algorithms were the cubic SVM, with an average F1 score of 76.1%, the fine KNN, with\na score of 76.9%, and the wide ANN, with a score of 78.2%. The fine KNN algorithm had the highest performing\nvalidation and test accuracy scores, with 87.8% and 86.4% respectively. The quadratic SVM utilised a quadratic kernel\nto determine the boundaries between classes. The fine KNN was trained for the recognition of 1 neighbour. The wide\nANN was a single fully connected layer with over 100 neurons between the input and output layers.\nWith the greatest average performance across all classes, the ML algorithm that was chosen for the recognition of\nmovement was the wide ANN. The evaluation and test accuracies for the ANN are 87.7% and 85.2% respectively.\nFigure 19 shows the corresponding F1 scores for the correct and incorrectly movement recognition for the ANN.\n4\nDiscussion\nThe results show that postural movement recognition is a feasible option through the analysis of PPG distortions.\nBetween the moving and stationary measurements, the expected changes to the PPG signal occurs [27]. As seen in\n12\n\nML Assisted Postural Movement Detection using PPG\nTable 2: Machine learning algorithm evaluations with accuracy scores for each model and F1 scores for each class. S =\nStationary, SS = Sitting-to-standing and LS = Lying-to-standing.\nFigure 8, the effect of orthostatic stress and baroreflex response [10] can be observed in the increase in the blood\nvolume at 30 seconds due to the movement and the decrease back to the values found before the movement at 40\nseconds. The differences between the magnitudes of these changes between movements, with the lying-to-standing\nmovements having larger variations compared to the sitting-to-standing. This allowed the wide ANN to recognise\n13\n\nML Assisted Postural Movement Detection using PPG\nthe postural movements. Compared to similar HAR studies for standalone PPG signals, the proposed method had\na similar performance for the recognition of the recognition of these activities [11]. This system would allow for a\ngeneral-purpose monitoring system to be used by care home staff to monitor people at risks of falls around their room.\nThe greater performance for the ML algorithm in classifying the stationary PPG signals could have been due to the\nregular morphology of the stationary PPG pulses compared to the PPG signals distorted due to movement. For a\nstationary participant, the number of factors that can increase the variability of the PPG signal is less than compared\nto if the participant is moving. This allows for clearer patterns to be found in the features. Furthermore, the higher\nperformance of the lying-to-standing movements compared to the sitting-to-standing can be attributed to the more\ncomplex and the increased time taken for the movement. For a younger adult, these differences may be reduced.\nHowever, for those a risk of falls, such as elderly people, OH and age related reductions in the baroreflex [26] increase\nthe length and magnitudes of the distortions. The greater changes could increase the performance of the recognition\nof movements. However, this would have to be further investigated with elderly participants completing postural\nmovements.\nThe Chi-squared test showed that the features that had the greatest impact on recognising the types of movement were\nthose associated with systolic point and the features with the lowest impact were those associated with the diastolic\npoint and the dicrotic notch. This indicates that changes in the movement were more noticeable and identifiable for the\nfeatures involving the systolic point.\nThe overlap between class features meant that algorithms that looked for clear boundaries in large groups of data\nperformed worse than algorithms that observed differences in classes in more complex, local groupings. Linear\nboundary classifiers were among the lowest performing models, with an average F1 score of 42.6% for LDA and\n37.38% for Linear SVM. The overlap meant that ANN were able to perform particularly well, with the highest average\nF1 score for the three classes, as the algorithm allows for complex mapping of inputs and outputs. When comparing the\nwide ANN to the other single layer ANN, the larger layer size increased the overall performance of the model. The\nincreased size allows for a greater capacity in learning more complex patterns in the dataset, thus allowing for a better\nability to differentiate between classes.\nThis study has several limitations. Even though the condition for the recording of postural movements were an issue\nthat has to be considered was segment distribution imbalance. 79% of the segments in the dataset were related to when\nthe device wearer was stationary before the movement and after the blood volume had returned to baseline values. The\nremaining segments were distributed between the sitting-to-standing and lying-to-standing transition recognition sets.\nTo give a better representation of the performance for individual classes, metric such as the precision, sensitivity and\nF1 score were used. However, due to the limited data set representing the movement of the individual, resampling\nmethods that equalised the number of segments per class would greatly reduce the overall dataset training and evaluation\nsize. This could lead to issues such as overfitting, bias and a low performance in real-world recognition of postural\nmovements.\nMoreover, the data set was taken from young adults. To improve the accuracy of the model for the purpose of fall\nprevention in a care home, further work would be required to investigate the relationship between the changes in the\nPPG signal with movement with those more at risk of falls.\n5\nConclusion\nThis study explored the feasibility of employing a PPG sensor in combination with machine learning techniques to\nrecognize various postural movements. A specialized hardware device was developed to capture and wirelessly transmit\nPPG signals from individuals as they transitioned from sitting and lying positions to standing. The data collected from\nthese activities formed a comprehensive database used for subsequent analysis.\nMachine learning algorithms DT, DA,NB,SVM,KNN and ANN was applied to classify these postural movements, with\nthe F1 score serving as the primary metric to evaluate the effectiveness of each algorithm. Results indicated that the\nANN model achieved an accuracy of 85% and an average F1-score of 78%, positioning it as the most effective model\nfor this application. These findings suggest that the integration of PPG sensors with ML algorithms holds promise for\naccurate recognition of postural transitions in inclusive settings.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partially supported by University of Bristol internal funding.\n14\n\nML Assisted Postural Movement Detection using PPG\nReferences\n[1] ‘Elderly people and falls: how healthcare can better support the UK’s ageing population’, PPP Taking Care.
