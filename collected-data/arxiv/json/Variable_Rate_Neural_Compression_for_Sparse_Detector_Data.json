Introduction\n1.1. Background\nHigh-energyparticlecolliders,suchastheLargeHadronCollider(LHC)[1]\nandtheRelativisticHeavyIonCollider(RHIC)[2], arecriticaltoolsforprob-\ning the fundamental building blocks of matter. In these experiments, pro-\ntons and heavy ions are accelerated to velocities approaching the speed of\n2\ncalorimeters\nTPC\nsilicon tracker\nFigure 1: sPHENIX detector assembly. Time projection chamber (TPC) con-\ntributes the majority of data.\nlight and providing collisions at extremely high energies (for RHIC nucleon-\nnucleon center of mass energy is 200GeV in heavy ion collisions up to and\n510GeV in proton-proton collisions). These complex interactions generate a\nmultitude of subatomic particles (thousands of particles in the central heavy\nion collisions), enabling scientists to explore the deepest questions about the\nnature of the universe. To capture the products of collisions, the interac-\ntion point is surrounded by the state of art particle detectors. Recently\nconstructed sPHENIX experiment [2] at RHIC focuses on studying the mi-\ncroscopic properties of strongly interacting matter, such as the quark-gluon\nplasma, a state of matter that existed in the early universe.\nToachievethis,sPHENIXemploysanarrayofadvancedparticledetectors\n(Figure 1). The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) [3] is the primary tracking\ndetector. The TPC acts as a three-dimensional (3D) camcorder, continu-\n3\nously recording the trajectories of charged particles as they pass through its\ndetection volume. As particles move through the TPC, they ionize the gas\nmolecules, creating clusters of charge. Clusters drift in the electric field to\nthe readout pads and induce electrical signals. These signals (hits) are reg-\nistered by 160 thousand detector channels. Both the position and time of a\nhit are captured by one of the 40 million voxels in a 3D grid of the active de-\ntection volume. The system then digitizes these signals, transforming them\ninto analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) values. The TPC readout digitizes\n3.2 trillion voxels per second and generates terabits per second of data after\nzero suppression.\nTraditionally, collider experiments have relied on a level-1 trigger system\nto manage the massive data output by selecting only the most significant\ncollision events for storage, while discarding less valuable data. However,\nnext-generation collider experiments, including sPHENIX, are moving to-\nwards streaming data acquisition (DAQ) systems [4, 5, 6], which aim to con-\ntinuously record a large fraction to all collision events. While this approach\nmaximizes the physics output, it presents a critical challenge: handling the\nimmense data volume in real time.\nTo reduce the TPC data volume while preserving key information, ef-\nficient data compression techniques are essential. This paper introduces a\ndeep neural network-based lossy compression algorithm designed to meet\nthe high-throughput demands of streaming DAQ systems. Moreover, unlike\nspecialized algorithms tailored specifically for TPC data [7], our approach\nis data-driven and makes no assumptions about the underlying physics, al-\nlowing it to generalize to other datasets with similar characteristics, such as\n4\nthose for the future electron-ion collider [6, 5].\n1.2. Related Work and Research Gaps\nConventional scientific lossy compression methods are motivated in fields\nsuch as climate science, fluid dynamics, cosmology, and molecular dynamics.\nThese methods have been driven by the necessity to handle large datasets\nproduced by distributed and high-fidelity simulations in a high-performance\ncomputing environment. For example, the error-bounded SZ compression\nalgorithm[8,9,10]hasproveneffectiveforcompressingdatafromclimatesci-\nenceandcosmologysimulations. OtherexamplesincludetheZFPmethod[11],\nwhich was developed specifically for hydrodynamics simulations, and the\nMGARD method [12, 13], which was designed to compress turbulent chan-\nnel flow and climate simulation data.\nWhile there is extensive research on general-purpose lossy compression,\nfew existing methods are optimized for highly sparse data. Although the\naforementioned compression algorithms have demonstrated reasonable per-\nformancewithTPCdata,noneofthemarespecificallytailoredforthistypeof\ninput. Inthiscontext,aspecializedneuralnetwork-basedcompressionmodel,\nthe Bicephalous Convolutional Auto-Encoder (BCAE), introduced in [14] and\nlater refined in [15], has been shown to outperform traditional methods in\nterms of both compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy for sparse TPC\ndata.\nHowever, despite the BCAE’s superior performance, its design treats the\nsparsity of TPC data as a challenge to overcome rather than as an oppor-\ntunity to improve compression efficiency. The BCAE model compresses data\nby mapping the input array to a fixed-size code, regardless of the input’s\n5\noccupancy (i.e., the fraction of non-zero elements). This results in ineffi-\nciencies: when the code size is large enough to accommodate inputs with\nhigh signal occupancy, there is wasted space for sparser inputs; conversely,\nwhen the code size is optimized for sparser inputs, denser inputs suffer from\ninformation loss during compression.\n1.3. Challenges and Solutions\nChallenge 1. Occupancy-based variable compression ratio. While\nTPC data on average exhibits low occupancy (around 10%), the actual oc-\ncupancy can vary significantly. For instance, in the dataset used for model\ndevelopment, occupancy ranges from less than 5% to over 25%. Therefore,\nthere is a need for compression algorithms capable of producing larger codes\nfor denser inputs and smaller codes for sparser ones.\nSolution. We propose BCAE-VS, a bicephalous autoencoder that provides\na variable compression ratio based on TPC data occupancy. The design of\nBCAE-VS is motivated by the hypothesis that a trajectory can be reliably\nreconstructed from a subset of signals. Consequently, data compression can\nbe achieved by selectively down-sampling signals rather than resizing the input\narray. To implement this, BCAE-VS’s encoder predicts the importance of each\nsignal in the input array for trajectory reconstruction. Signals with higher\nimportance are treated as analogous to the key points that anchor shapes\nin computer vision tasks such as action and gesture recognition [16, 17, 18,\n19]. Compression is achieved by saving only the coordinates and neural\nrepresentations of these key points.\nChallenge 2. Leveraging sparsity for throughput. Despite the im-\npressive reconstruction accuracy of BCAE-VS, implementing its encoder with\n6\nconventional (dense) convolution operations will lead to constant computa-\ntion time disregarding input data with changing sparsity and complexity.\nSolution. We use sparse convolution for implementing BCAE-VS’s encoder.\nWith a manageable runtime overhead, the sparse convolution-powered en-\ncoder of BCAE-VS generates output only for the signals with input exclusively\nfrom the signals and skips all matrix multiplications with all-zero operands.\nAs the overhead and the number of non-zero values vary with occupancy,\nBCAE-VS achieves a variable throughput that increases significantly as occu-\npancy decreases.\nMain Contributions:\n• Introduction of BCAE-VS: We propose BCAE-VS, an improved BCAE\nmodel enabling Variable compression ratio for Sparse data. This model\naims to enhance both compression efficiency and reconstruction accu-\nracy by selectively down-sampling signals rather than reducing the size\nof the input array.\n• Improved reconstruction performance: BCAE-VS achieves a 75%\nimprovement in reconstruction accuracy and a 10% higher compression\nratio on average compared to the most accurate BCAE model.\n•\nUse of sparse convolution for high throughput: To address the\ncomputationalinefficienciesofconventionalconvolutionwithhighspar-\nsity data, BCAE-VS employs sparse convolution. This approach pro-\ncesses only the relevant signals, significantly reducing the computa-\ntional overhead associated with matrix multiplications involving all-\nzero operands.\n7\n2. TPC Data\n2.1. Overview\nFigure 2 shows a schematic view of sPHENIX TPC. sPHENIX TPC is\na cylindrical gas-filled drift chamber. Working gas mixture is 75% argon\n(Ar), 20% carbon tetrafluoride (CF ), and 5% isobutane (C H ). Collisions\n4 4 10\nhappeninthecenteroftheTPC.Chargedparticlesproducedinthecollisions\ntraverse the volume of the TPC at a speed close to the speed of light. As\ncharged particles travel, they ionize the gas atoms along trajectories and\ncreate trails of electrons and ions. Extremely uniform electric field E =\n400Vcm−1 provides uniform drift velocity for electron clouds drift towards\nthe readout planes. The positions and arrival times of the electrons are\nrecorded by the sensors arranged in concentric layers on the readout planes.\nGasionizationbyaparticledependsonlyonitsvelocityandthesquareofthe\ncharge, thus the density of the electron cloud allows to distinguish different\nparticles, e.g. protons, kaons, and pions. The chamber is placed within the\nmagnetic field of a superconducting magnet, which provides a magnetic field\nB = 1.4T collinear with the electric field. Trajectory of the particle is bent\nby the magnetic field along the axial direction. This bending allows for the\ndetermination of the momenta and charges of the particles based on the\ncurvature of their trajectory.\nThe sPHENIX TPC readout plane has three groups of layers: inner,\nmiddle, and outer. Each layer group produces a readout of a 3D (axial,\nradial, and azimuthal) array of ADC values. Each array has 16 layers along\nthe radial direction and 249 temporal sampling points (for one TPC drift\ntime window) along the axial direction on each side of the TPC, representing\n8\nB\nE E\ntrajectory\nionized\nelectrons\ninteraction\npoint\ncentral\nmembrane\nreadout\nplane\nreadout\nplane\nFigure 2: A schematic view of sPHENIX TPC.\ntime evolution. The number of readout pads along the azimuthal direction\nincreases from inner to outer layers. The number is constant within a layer\ngroup and it is 1152, 1536, and 2304, respectively. In this study, we will focus\non the 16 layers of the outer group of the TPC with 2304 readout pads along\nthe azimuthal direction. Each element in the (layer, pad, temporal) array is\nmapped to a voxel in the 3D space. We demonstrate a full azimuthal outer\nlayer group readout in Figure 3A (experiment 3060, event 8 in the test split\nof the dataset).\nTo match the subdivision of the readout electronics in the TPC readout\nchain, the data from a layer group has the same division. It has 24 equal-size\nnon-overlapping sections: 12 along the azimuthal direction (30 degrees per\nsection) and 2 along the axial direction (separated by the transverse plane\npassing the collision point). We call these sections TPC wedges. Figure 3B\nshows a zoom-in view of one of the wedges from the outer layer group.

All ADC data from the same\nwedge will be transmitted to the same group of front-end electronics, after\nwhich a real-time lossy compression algorithm could be deployed. There-\nfore, TPC wedges are used as the direct input to the deep neural network\ncompression algorithms.\n2.2. Dataset and Preprocessing\nTo train a compression algorithm, we used a dataset containing 1310 sim-\n√\nulated events for central s = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions with 170kHz\nNN\npileup collisions1. The data were generated with the HIJING event genera-\n1Zenodo linked: https://zenodo.org/records/10028587\n10\ntor [20] and Geant4 Monte Carlo detector simulation package [21] integrated\nwith the sPHENIX software framework [22].\nThe simulated TPC readout (ADC values) from these events are repre-\nsented as 10-bit unsigned integers ∈ [0,1023]. To reduce unnecessary data\ntransmission, azero-suppression algorithmhasbeenapplied. AllADCvalues\nbelow 64 are set to be zero as large fraction of them represent noise. This\nzero-compression makes the TPC data sparse at about 10.8% occupancy of\nnon-zero values. A voxel that has a non-zero ADC value is a signal voxel. A\nvoxel with a 0 ADC value is a non-signal voxel.\nWe divide the 1310 total events into 1048 events for training and 262\nfor testing. Each event contains 24 outer-layer wedges. Thus, the training\npartition contains 25152 TPC outer-layer wedges, while the testing portion\nhas 6288.\nFinally, as trajectory coordinates must be interpolated from neighboring\nsensors using the ADC values, it is important to preserve the relative ADC\nratiobetweenthesensors. Hence,forthisstudy,weworkwithlog ADC values\n(defined as log (ADC+1)) instead of the raw ADC values. A log ADC value\n2\nis a float number ∈ [0.,10.]. As zero-suppression is implemented at 64 for this\ndataset, and all nonzero log-ADC values exceed 6. Zero-suppression makes\nthe distribution of ADC bimodal and extremely skewed.\nRemark: This distribution presents a significant challenge for neural\nnetwork-basedalgorithmssinceneuralnetworktendstoworkwellwheninput\ndata is distributed approximately normally [23, 24]. In Section 3.1 we will\nshow one approach to handle the discontinuity in the data distribution with\na compression autoencoder equipped with two collaborating decoders. We\n11\nwill discuss the limitation of this approach and provide a better solution in\nSection 3.2 with sparse convolution. As a result, the sparsity of the data\nis no longer an obstacle to overcome but rather an advantage that we can\nleverage.\n3. Method\n3.1. Bicephalous Convolutional Autoencoder\nTo address the problem caused by the difficult distribution of log ADC\nvalue, Bicephalous Convolutional Autoencoder (BCAE) was proposed in [14]\nandlateroptimizedin[15]. ABCAEisanautoencoderwithtwodecoders–one\nforsegmentationandtheotherforregression(SeeFigure4). Duringtraining,\na code significantly smaller than the input is generated by the encoder and\nfed to the decoders. The segmentation decoder, D , will output a score\nseg\ns ∈ (0,1) for each voxel in the input. The weights of D are updated by\nseg\ncomparing s to the true label of the input – 1 for a signal voxel and 0 for\na non-signal voxel. The regression decoder, D , will output a value r for\nreg\neach voxel. Given a threshold s ∈ (0,1), the predicted value (rˆ) at each\n0\nvoxel is set to r if s > s and to 0 if otherwise. The weights of D are then\n0 reg\nupdated by comparing rˆ to the true input value of the voxel. The weights\nof the encoder E are updated with the combined gradient information from\nboth decoders. During inference, we only run the encoder part and save the\ncode to storage for later use.\nThe design of BCAE is motivated by two considerations: reconstruction\naccuracy and efficiency. First, the segmentation decoder is tasked to tackle\nthediscontinuityintheinputdatadistributionsothattheregressiondecoder\n12\ncan focus solely on approximating the ADC values. Second, having two\ndecoders does not affect the compression (inference) throughput as only the\nencoder will be executed during compression. From the first consideration,\nwe can see that a better solution with respect to reconstruction accuracy\nmight be to have two single-tasking encoder-decoder pairs. However, since\nthe encoding will run in real-time in deployment, it is crucial to keep the\nencoder simple and lightweight as much as possible for the high TPC data\nrate. Additionally, as demonstrated in [15], the possible adverse effect of a\nsimple encoder could be compensated to some extent by a more complicated\ndecoder.\nsegmentationloss\nlabel\nsegmentation segmentation\ndecoderDs output\nrecon-\ninputx encoderE code struction\nregression regression\ndecoderDr output\nfeed-forward\nback-propagation element-wise\nhardthresholding multiplication\nregressionloss\nFigure 4: Bicephalous convolutional autoencoder.\nAlthoughBCAEhasbeenshowntooutperformexistingnon-neuralnetwork-\nbased compression algorithms in reconstruction accuracy at equal or higher\ncompression ratio [14], the approach does not leverage the sparsity of the\ninput. First, its dense convolution incurs static computation costs despite\nvarying input sparsity. Second, to produce a significantly smaller code, the\ndown-sizing in the encoder breaks the sparsity of the input. This makes it\n13\nhard for the decoders to reconstruct a trajectory at its correct location, espe-\ncially in higher occupancy areas (see Figure 10). Finally, for BCAE, the same\ncode length is used regardless of data sparsity. This means that if a chosen\ncode length is suitable for sparse and relatively simple data, it will become\ninsufficient for denser and more complex ones.\n3.2. BCAE-VS for Key-Point Identification\nFigure3Cshowsa close-up viewofatypicaltrajectory formedbyastreak\nof signal patches. The localized and seemingly redundant signal voxels of the\nsame patch suggest the possibility of reconstructing the trajectory with only\na fraction of them. As a starter, we performed a sanity check by randomly\nmasking out 50% of signal voxels and used a neural network to reconstruct\nthe original input. This compression by random sampling does not even\nrequire a learnable encoder network! The reconstruction mean squared error\n(MSE) (in raw ADC) is 95, which is much smaller than the 218 reported\nin [14].\nThese results suggest that if randomly selected signal voxels can perform\neffectivelyinreconstruction, acarefullyselected subsetofsignalvoxelsshould\nyield even better performance. Such a subset is analogous to the key points\nin computer vision, to which location a geometric shape is anchored. This\nconcept led to the development of BCAE-VS whose encoder compresses by\ndown-selecting signal voxels rather than down-sizing the whole input array.\nTo achieve compression by down-selecting, an encoder assigns an impor-\ntance score to each signal voxel, retaining only those with higher importance\nand discarding the rest. However, implementing such an encoder with stan-\ndard (dense) convolutions requires running 3D convolutions that maintain\n14\nthe input dimension, which can be relatively slow [15]. This is where sparse\nconvolution becomesapotentiallybetteralternative, asitcancomputesolely\nfor the signal voxels and use input exclusively from them.\nThis section is structured as follows: Section 3.2.1 explains the operation\nof BCAE-VS. Section 3.2.2 contrasts sparse convolution with dense convolu-\ntion. In Section 3.2.3, we explore using random thresholding for identifying\nkey signal voxels. Finally, Section 3.2.4 addresses the balance between com-\npression and reconstruction in BCAE-VS.\n3.2.1. The Working of BCAE-VS\nA.

We\nwillusextodenotean-dimensionalarrayandx todenotethesparseformof\ns\nx with only the location and value of the non-zero entries specified. Although\n15\nx and x represent the same input, the different notations emphasize the fact\ns\nthat zeros (non-signal voxels) do not occupy any space in x while x contains\ns\nall the zeros.\nAs demonstrated in Figure 5, for each entry in a TPC wedge x , the en-\ns\ncoder E of BCAE-VS produces two outputs, importance score p and value v.\nThe importance score output helps us determine the contribution of signal\nvoxel in accurate reconstruction and the value is what we will save to the\nstorage should the voxel be selected. There are two reasons for letting E pro-\nduce v instead of using the original (raw or log) ADC value for reconstruction\n(as we did in the “encoder-free” compression). First, since we will have to\nsave a value for a selected voxel anyway, an adjusted value produced by a\ntrained neural network may be more helpful than the original (raw or log)\nADC value. Second, the gain in inference speed from having one less output\nchannel is marginal according to our experiment (at least for the specific\nsparse convolution implementation we chose for this work).\nDuring the training of BCAE-VS, we pass importance score p through\na soft mask function with an element-wise random threshold to get a soft\nmask m. The element-wise multiplication of v and m form the input to the\ndecoders. For inference (compression only), the random soft thresholding\nwill be replaced by a random hard thresholding. More details on the soft\nmask and random thresholding will be discussed in Section 3.2.\n3.2.2. Sparse Convolution\nFor symbolic simplicity, we explain sparse convolution with input with\ntwo spatial dimensions, height and width. Generalization to a higher dimen-\nsional input is straightforward. We use s and d to denote the stride and\n16\ndilation of a convolution, and K and K to denote the kernel window for\nh w\nthe height and width direction, respectively. For example, for convolution\nwith kernel size 3, we have K = K = [−1,0,1]. We use i, o, h, w, k , and\nh w h\nk to iterate through the input and output channels, height and width, and\nw\nthe kernel, respectively. The output Y can be calculated from the weight W,\nbias b, and input X as follows:\n(cid:88)\nY = W X +b\no,h,w o,i,kh,kw i,sh+dkh,sw+dkw o\ni,kh,kw\n(cid:88) (cid:88)\n= W X +b (1)\no,i,kh,kw i,sh+dkh,sw+dkw o\nkh,kw i\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nmatrixmultiplication\n(cid:80)\nFor a dense convolution, the summation is taken over K = K ×K\nkh,kw h w\nand hence we cannot avoid the matrix multiplication in Equation 1 even if\nthe input vector X is an all-zero vector. However, for a sparse\ni,sh+dkh,sw+dkw\nconvolution, the summation is taken over\nK = {(k ,k )|(sh+dk , sw+dk ) ∈ S} ⊂ K\nh,w h w h w\nwhere S is the collection of coordinates in a sparse input. The map (h,w) (cid:55)→\nK is commonly referred to as the kernel map in the sparse convolution\nh,w\nliterature.\nTherearetwotypesofsparseconvolution: normalandsubmanifoldsparse\nconvolution. Let N = {(sh+dk , sw+dk )|(k ,k ) ∈ K} be the neigh-\nh,w h w h w\nborhood of (h,w) with respect to the kernel, normal sparse convolution com-\nputes for a coordinate (h,w) if N ∩ S is not empty, while submanifold\nh,w\n17\nsparse convolution only computes for (h,w) ∈ S. Since normal sparse con-\nvolution will introduce new entries to S every time the convolution with\nkernel size > 1 is applied, and breaks the sparsity, we use submanifold sparse\nconvolution for the BCAE-VS encoder.\nAs we can see from the discussion above, while sparse convolution can re-\nduceruntimebyavoidingcomputationsonzeroinput,itincursoverheadfrom\ncomputing kernel maps. Consequently, sparse convolution is more efficient\nat lower sparsity but loses its advantage as sparsity decreases. Additionally,\nthe efficiency of sparse convolution varies with the specific implementation.\nFor this work, we use the MinkowskiEngine library from NVIDIA2, as it pro-\nvides the highest throughput on the hardware used in this research. Details\non throughput are available in Section 4.3.\n3.2.3.

A soft mask is obtained by φ(p,θ) (right).\nThe problem of key-point identification in TPC data compression can be\nthought of as a “self-supervised classification” problem. It is a classification\nproblem since we want to predict a label 1 for a signal voxel crucial for\naccurate reconstruction and a 0 for a non-essential one. It is a self-supervised\nproblem since we do not have a ground truth label to match but have to infer\nthe label by observing the effect of keeping or discarding a signal voxel on\nreconstruction.\nFor this goal, we designed the random thresholding approach that works\nas follows. For a signal voxel with predicted importance score p, we generate\na random number θ ∼ Uniform(0,1), and calculate a soft mask with the\nfunction defined in Equation 2\nφ(p,θ;α,ε) = sigmoid(α[logit(p,ε)−logit(θ,ε)]) (2)\nThe ε in the logit function is used to improve numerical stability (p or 1−p\nless than ε will be replaced with ε). We set ε = 10−8 for this study. Plots of\nφ with varying threshold θ and α are shown in Figure 6. We can see that φ\n19\nis a differentiable approximation to the step function with a step at θ. For a\nfixed θ, α increases the steepness of φ when making the transition from 0 to\n1. For this study, we set α = 4.\n3.2.4. Balancing Reconstruction with Compression\nTo train BCAE-VS, we need to balance the reconstruction accuracy with\ncompression. We do this by adjusting the reconstruction loss L and\nrecon\ncompression loss L .\ncomp\nThe reconstruction loss L is the weighted sum of the segmentation\nrecon\nloss L and the regression loss L .

The reason\nthat we did not use the regression output transform approach (mapping all\nregression output to above 6) introduced in dense BCAEs [15] is because it\nmakes the training of BCAE-VS unstable.\nWe measured the reconstruction accuracy in L , L , peak signal-to-noise\n1 2\nratio (PSNR), recall, and precision and listed the result in Table 1.

The encoder size is measured by trainable parame-\nters. The throughput is measured by the number of TPC wedges processed\nper second.\nWe also plot the dependence of reconstruction accuracy on occupancy\nin Figure 8 for L and PSNR and in Figure 9 for recall and precision. We\n1\ncan observe that the reconstruction accuracy metrics (L , recall, and preci-\n1\nsion) of the dense BCAE models depend linearly on occupancy with a strong\ncorrelation. On the contrary, in a wide range of occupancy where the TPC\nwedges are the most populated, the sparse model BCAE-VS’s performance\nis correlated weakly with occupancy and maintains a superior performance.\nHowever, towards the two ends of the occupancy distribution, the BCAE-VS\nstarts to fail. From Figure 9, we can observe that the failure of BCAE-VS is\n23\nnoitcurtsnocer\necnereffid\nnoitcurtsnocer\necnereffid\ndriven by a drastic decline in recall for extremely high-occupancy input and\nby precision for low-occupancy ones.\nInFigure10, wecompareBCAEs’reconstructionperformancequalitatively\non two TPC wedges. The difference is calculated by subtracting reconstruc-\ntion from the ground truth. From the comparison, we can make two ob-\nservations. First, dense BCAEs (BCAE-2D, BCAE-HT, BCAE++) have difficulty\nreconstructing a track at its correct location while BCAE-VS conserves the\ntrack location even in densely packed regions. This is evident with the cloud\nof blue and red dots and the lack thereof in the plot of difference. Sec-\nond, dense BCAEs under-perform in input region with higher occupancy while\nBCAE-VS maintains accurate reconstruction over a wider range of occupancy.\n4.2. Compression Ratio\nThe compression ratio of the algorithm depends on data precision and\nthe format of storage of the input and the code.\nOn the input side, raw ADC values from TPC are collected as 10-bit\nintegers. However, since most commonly used computing platforms cannot\nhandle 10-bit integers, we consider input ADC values as 16-bits floats. For\nthe input size, we follow the convention in the dense BCAEs works [15, 14]\nand define it as the size of the zero-padded regularly shaped tensors.\nWith respect to the precision of the code, although we train all models\nin full precision (float32), it is shown in [15] that the difference in accuracy\nbetween reconstruction from full-precision compressed data and those down-\ncasttofloat16isnegligible. SimilarobservationcanalsobemadeforBCAE-VS\naccording to Table 2. Hence, compressed data is saved in float16 format for\nall models.\n24\nTable 2: Reconstruction accuracy with full (float32) and half (float16) precision code.\nprecision L L PSNR recall precision\n1 2\nhalf .028394 .088652 26.000 .988447 .995573\nfull .028415 .088818 25.996 .988419 .995569\nSince a dense encoder output a code as a regularly shaped tensor, the\ncompression ratio of a dense BCAE can be calculated directly as the ratio\nof the input size to the code size. However, since the code produced by the\nsparse encoder of BCAE-VS is a sparse tensor, to compute a compression ratio\ncomparable to those of the dense models, we need the following conversion.\nAssume that the Coordinate List (COO) format is used for saving the output\nfrom the sparse encoder of BCAE-VS. We need to save the location and value\nof all entries in v whose corresponding value in p is larger than a (random)\nthreshold. Since a TPC wedge has shape (16,192,249), we need 4 bit to\nspecify the index of in the first dimension, and 8 bits each for the second\nand last dimensions. Hence we need (4+8+8)+16 = 36 bits to save one\nentry in v. Suppose the occupancy of the wedge is o and a fraction k of the\nentries in v will be retained, the compression ratio C for this wedge can be\ncalculated using the following formula\n16bits×input size 4\nC = = (3)\n36bits×input size×o×k 9ok\nOver the test split of the dataset, on average a fraction of .133 of the\nsignal voxels is retained for each wedge. The averaged compression ratio is\n33.9 with wedge-wise compression ratio calculated using Equation 3. The left\npanel of Figure 11 shows compression ratio and retention ratio as a function\n25\nretentionfraction,mean=.133\n100 0.15\ncompressionratio,mean=33.9\n80 0.14\n60 0.13\n40 0.12\n20 0.11\n00..0055 00..11 00..1155 00..22 00..2255\noccupancy\nFigure 11: Compression ratio, retention fraction (left), and importance assign-\nment to the signal voxels (right).\nof occupancy. While the dependency of retention on occupancy is relatively\nweak, BCAE-VS tends to retain more signal voxels at higher occupancy. This\nbehavior is desirable, as more voxels need to be preserved for accurate re-\nconstruction when trajectories are closer together. The compression ratio,\non the other hand, exhibits a clear inverse relationship to occupancy. These\nobservations demonstratedBCAE-VS’s ability todynamicallyadjust key-point\nidentification and achieve a variable compression ratio.\nWe also visualize the importance score assignment by the encoder of\nBCAE-VS on isolated tracks in the right panel of Figure 11. We can see\nthat the assignment is polarized – most of the probabilities are close to zero\nand only a small fraction of signal voxels along the boundary of a track are\nassigned with a high importance score.\n4.3. Throughput\nUnlike dense convolutions, the inference speed of sparse convolution de-\npends on occupancy.

Therefore, in an occupancy regime where the\nspeed gain reduced matrix multiplications outweigh the overhead of com-\nputing the kernel map, BCAE-VS may achieve lower compression latency.\nTo test this hypothesis, we conducted a throughput study using a NVIDIA\nRTXTM 6000 ADA graphic card with driver 555.42.02 and PyTorch 2.4.0\ncompiled with CUDA 12.23 and demonstrate the result in Figure 12. Here,\nthroughput is measured as the number of TPC wedges compressed per sec-\nond.\n3A fix build of MinkowskiEngine for CUDA 12.2 can be found at https://github.\ncom/NVIDIA/MinkowskiEngine/pull/567\n27\ntuphguorht\ntnuoc\nThe throughput for each dense BCAE is averaged from 1000 batches with\na warm-up of 10 batches. We evaluated throughput under the assumption\nthat the input data is already stored in GPU memory. Figure 12 presents\nthe peak throughput of each dense model, with the corresponding batch size\nthat achieved the peak noted in the legend. All the dense BCAEs are compiled\nusing torch.compile to optimize the inference speed.\nFor BCAE-VS, each test sample was repeated 64 times to generate the\ninput. We assume the input batch of TPC wedges is already in GPU memory\ninasparse-encodedformat, readyfordirectprocessingbythesparsenetwork.\nThis assumption is reasonable as the TPC data is collected and transferred\nin sparse encoding through the data acquisition pipeline.\nThe throughput is calculated on the test split of the dataset consisting of\n6288 TPC wedges. Although BCAE-VS is slower than BCAE-2D and BCAE-HT\non average, it is significantly faster in the lower occupancy regime. Moreover,\nsparse models can process sparsely encoded TPC data directly, eliminating\nthe overhead of padding sparse encoding to a full tensor necessitated by a\ndense model. In many operational modes of collider tracking detectors, the\noccupancy can be significantly more sparse, e.g. on the order of 10−3-10−2 for\nthe TPC in the sPHENIX experiment during proton-proton collisions, which\nis much lower than in the high-pileup central Au+Au dataset studied in this\nwork. The advantages of sparse convolution become increasingly pronounced\nin such conditions.\n28\n5. Conclusion\nWe introduced BCAE-VS, an algorithm designed to enhance the compres-\nsion of sparse 3D TPC data from high-energy particle accelerators. BCAE-VS\noffers a variable compression ratio based on data occupancy, improving both\ncompression efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. Our results show a 75%\nincrease in reconstruction accuracy with a 10% higher average compression\nratio compared to the leading BCAE model. By utilizing sparse convolution,\nBCAE-VS achieves an outstanding throughput within the operational occu-\npancy range of sPHENIX. While the current model demonstrates promising\nperformance, several limitations have been identified. We offer recommen-\ndations for future work to address these constraints and further enhance the\nmodel’s capabilities.\n• Exact control of retention fraction: Although hyperparameters such\nas L and l (see Section 3.2.4) can influence BCAE-VS’s the re-\ncomp prob\ntention fraction, we lack a direct control of it. A potential solution\ncould involve thresholding by quantile of the importance score output\np (see Section 3.2.1), allowing a fixed fraction of signals to be saved.\n• Performance at extreme occupancies: While BCAE-VS performs well\nfor typical occupancy levels in the dataset, it experiences a significant\ndecrease in recall at high occupancy and in precision at low occupancy.\nFordeployment,weneedanalgorithmthatremainsreliableevenduring\nextreme events.\n• Precision and quantization for throughput: The sparse convolution li-\nbrary MinkowskiEngine does not support half-precision (float16) op-\n29\nerations. As demonstrated in [15], certain hardware can achieve sub-\nstantial speedups with negligible performance loss using half-precision\ncomputation. Future work will explore more aggressive quantization\nschemes, such as int8, to further speed up inference.\n• Hardware support for sparse convolution: Unlike dense convolution,\nsparse convolution engines are not commonly supported by innovative\nAI hardware accelerators. This poses additional challenges for deploy-\ningBCAE-VSonsuchhardwarecomparedtodenseconvolutionalmodels.\n• Downstream task: Currently, the performance of BCAE-VS is evaluated\nwith standard classification/regression metrics. However, being a com-\npression algorithm of ADC readout, BCAE-VS’s performance needs to\nbe tested on downstream tasks such as trajectory reconstruction and\nidentification, which will be part of our future work.\n• Noisy TPC data from real experiment: In this study, we used simu-\nlated collision data. However, the TPC data from real experiments will\ncontain noises caused by, for example, common ground noise pickup.\nHence, BCAE-VS needs to be retrained and tested with realistic noisy\nconditions in the actual TPC data and adjusted to incorporate noise-\nfiltering mechanisms.\nAcknowledgment\nWe thank the sPHENIX collaboration for access to the simulated dataset,\nwhichwasusedinthetrainingandvalidationofouralgorithm.

BCAE-VS neural network\nThe BCAE-VS network consists of a sparse encoder implemented with\nsparse convolution provided by the NVIDIA MinkowskiEngine library and\ntwo decoders implemented with normal dense convolution. The input to the\nneural network is one TPC wedge treated as a 4D array with 1 channel and\n3 spatial dimensions.\nThe sparse encoder has five 3D convolution layers, all with 2 output\nchannels, kernel size 3, stride 1, and no padding. The dilation parameters\nof the convolutions are 1,2,4,2,1. There is a rectified linear unit (ReLU)\nactivationbetweentwosuccessiveconvolutionallayers. Theoutputactivation\nis Sigmoid.\nThe two decoders share the same structure. Each one of them has eight\n(dense) convolutional blocks with one convolution (kernel size 3, padding 1,\nstride 1, dilation 1) followed by a leaky ReLU with negative slope .1. The\nnumber of output channels are (16,16,16,8,8,8,4,2). A final 1 × 1 convo-\nlution maps the number of channels back to 1. The regression decoder D\nreg\nhas no output activation while the segmentation decoder D has Sigmoid\nseg\nas output activation.\nNo normalization is used in the BCAE-VS model.\n31\nAppendix B. BCAE-VS training\nThe training is done for 100 epochs with a batch size of 4 and 2000\nbatches per epoch. For optimization, we used the Adam optimizer with\ndecoupled weight decay (AdamW) with an initial learning rate 0.001, (β ,β ) =\n1 2\n(0.9,0.999), and weight decay 0.01. We kept the learning rate as initialized\nfor the first 20 epochs and decreased it to the 95% of the previous value every\n20 epochs thereafter.\nReferences\n[1] L. Evans, P.
