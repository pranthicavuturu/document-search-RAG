The philosophy\nof AI/algorithmic pluralism [9, 8, 18, 19] states that we should design AI systems such that they\nare capable of representing various individuals/groups, rather than aligning to a single “average”\nhuman preference – a practice that is unfortunately common in many current model training pipelines.\nOne mechanism for enabling pluralism is by constructing steerable models, i.e., models that can be\n(easily) made to adopt various behaviors [19].\nIn this paper, we propose a methodology for evaluating a model’s steerability with respect to\nprompting. We first propose a formal definition for prompt steerability – quantifying a model’s\nbehavior as a joint distribution, which we term a profile, computed via evaluation/score functions\non the distribution of model generations as a result of (a set of) input prompts. Using a dataset of\nmodel personas [14], we design a benchmark that measures the extent to which a model can be\nprompted to adopt various personas.

While there are a (growing) number of methods for steering models – via prompting\n[3, 11, 12], fine-tuning [14, 1], activations [16, 21, 20, 10], and other methods [7, 5, 6] – prompting\nis one of the most straightforward ways in which a typical user can influence a model’s behavior.\nOften it is not feasible for a user to fine-tune a model (either due to computational requirements or\nsimply due to not having access to the weights) or steer a model via its activations (which requires\nbeing able to access/modify a model’s internals during inference).\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).\narXiv:2411.12405v1  [cs.CL]  19 Nov 2024\n\nRelated work. Steerability is a closely related notion to model alignment, with much of the\ncommunity treating steering and aligning as interchangeable concepts. We emphasize, however,\nthat the notion of steerability describes the extent to which a model can be aligned/steered along\na given dimension. Some models can be aligned to a specific behavior more readily than others –\nthis is precisely what steerability aims to quantify. There is a variety of recent research concerning\nsteerability, ranging from theoretical to practical. Perhaps most prominent of the theoretical results\nis that of [22] in which the authors present an existence theorem stating that, under the assumption\nthat LLMs perform Bayesian inference, there exists a prompt that can amplify any existing model\nbehavior. It is worth emphasizing that the authors do not describe what this prompt looks like nor\nprescribe how to find this prompt, simply that it exists. Similar theoretical work [3] finds that there\nexist short prompt sequences that can significantly alter the probability of specific output tokens. On\nthe practical side, many recent papers propose algorithms for steering models to specific behaviors\n[23, 14, 16, 11, 21, 12]. Of the algorithmic papers, that of [14] is most relevant to the present paper,\nwith the fundamental difference being that the authors explore steerability with respect to fine-tuning\n(specifically via RL from human feedback) where our methodology studies prompting. Lastly, model\nsteerability is related to the notion of model sycophancy [15, 17, 13] with the primary difference\nbeing that the latter studies the degree to which the models mirror input biases in their outputs.\nContribution. Our primary contribution is the development of a steerability benchmark for evaluating\nthe degree to which a model can be prompted to take on various personas. We additionally introduce\nmetrics, termed steerability indices, to quantify the degree of steering. Our results complement the\nfine-tuning setting of [14] by analyzing steerability of model personas via prompting.\n2\nPrompt Steerability\nWe first define what we mean by prompt steerability. Given a generative language model Mθ, where\nθ is the set of model parameters, denote pθ as the probabilistic function that maps inputs/prompts\nx ∈X to outputs y ∈Y via y ∼pθ(x). Let S = {s1, . . . , sn} denote a set of score functions, i.e.,\nmetrics, where each si ∈S is a probabilistic function si : X × Y →P(Ei) from prompt-output pairs\n(x, y) to a score in an evaluation space Ei ⊆R, i.e., the values that score si can take.\nThe score functions S, along with a set of prompts X ⊆X, yield a measure of a given language\nmodel’s outputs, termed an evaluation profile. Formally, an evaluation profile is a joint distribution\npX ∈P = P(E), E = E1 × · · · × En, defined as\npX = E\n\u0002\np\n\u0000s(x, y)\n\u0001\n| y ∼pθ(x), x ∈X\n\u0003\n(1)\nwhere p(s(x, y)) is the joint distribution of scores s(x, y) = (s1(x, y), . . . , sn(x, y)) for a given\n(x, y) pair. In other words, a model’s evaluation profile (or simply profile) pX is the model’s expected\nbehavior on X as measured by the score functions S.\nA model’s prompt steerability measures the degree to which the model’s profile changes, as a function\nof prompting, along a set of steering dimensions. Define a prompt steering function σ : X →X as a\nfunction that generates modified prompts that influence the model’s outputs via y ∼pθ(σ(x)). Let\nD = {d1, . . . , dm} denote the set of steering dimensions and define σ+\ni (resp. σ−\ni ) as the positive\n(resp. negative) prompt steering function along steering dimension di. For example, directing a\nmodel to respond in a more positive or negative tone could be achieved by defining steering functions\n(σ+\ni , σ−\ni ) that appropriately modify the model’s system prompt. Define the positively and negatively\nsteered profiles along di as\npi+\nX = E\n\u0002\np\n\u0000s(x′, y)\n\u0001\n| y ∼pθ(x′), x′ = σ+\ni (x), x ∈X\n\u0003\n(2)\npi−\nX = E\n\u0002\np\n\u0000s(x′, y)\n\u0001\n| y ∼pθ(x′), x′ = σ−\ni (x), x ∈X\n\u0003\n(3)\nA model’s prompt steerability along di is the degree to which (pi+\nX , pi−\nX ) can be pulled away from\npX by construction of (σ+\ni , σ−\ni ).\nFurther quantification of a model’s prompt steerability is dependent upon the specific setting, requiring\na definition of both the precise steering functions as well as assigning an appropriate distance metric\nbetween profiles (distributions). We quantify these notions in the context of persona-based prompt\nsteerability in the following section.\n2\n\n3\nSteerability of Model Personas\nPrompt steerability of model’s persona describes the degree that a model can be made to adopt various\npersonas by prompting alone. We design a benchmark that enables measurement of this property.\n3.1\nBenchmark Design\nPersona data. Our benchmark is based on the evals/persona dataset1 which consists of model\npersona dimensions spanning personality, political views, ethical views, religious views, unsafe be-\nhaviors, and other topics [14]. The dataset contains multiple statements for each persona dimension\n(e.g., agreeableness, willingness-to-defer-to-experts, politically-liberal, etc.)\nand each direction (positive, negative). The statements are simple strings that are designed\nto align with a given persona dimension and direction (with their degree of alignment given by a\nlabel_confidence parameter). Additional details on the data can be found in Appendix A.1.\nMethodology. Both the steering and scoring of a model’s outputs are done via the persona statements.\nSpecifically, by decomposing the prompt as x = (xsys, xusr), where xsys is the system prompt and\nxusr is the user message, steering functions (σ+\ni,k, σ−\ni,k) operate on the system prompt only, that is,\nσ+\ni,k(x) = (σ+\ni,k(xsys), xusr), where σ+\ni,k(xsys) appends k steering statements (i.e., principles) to the\nsystem prompt. Scoring of the model’s outputs is done by asking the model (in the user message, xusr)\nif it would generate a given statement. Fig. 3 illustrates this procedure. By comparing the model’s\n(yes/no) answers to the user prompt with the statement’s true direction (and label confidence), we can\nconstruct estimates of the steered profiles (see Appendix A.2 for details).\nsteering to conscientiousness\nYou abide by the following principles: \nIt's important to keep very organized and clean. \nIt's important to do a thorough job in your work. \n. . .\n<latexit sha1_base64=\"AHCc49gMm/wQsXM8z1lRjTIBdE=\">AB83icbVDLSgNBEOyNrxhfUY9eBoPgKeyKqMegF48RzAOyS5idzCZDZh/M9EqWJb/\nhxYMiXv0Zb/6Nk2QPmljQUFR1093lJ1JotO1vq7S2vrG5Vd6u7Ozu7R9UD4/aOk4V4y0Wy1h1faq5FBFvoUDJu4niNPQl7/ju5nfeJKizh6xCzhXkiHkQgEo2gkd9J3kU8w15me9qs1u27PQVaJU5AaFGj2q1/uIGZpyCNkmrdc+wEvZwqFEzyacVNU8oG9Mh7xka0ZBrL5/fPCVnRhmQIFamIiRz9fdETkOts9A\n3nSHFkV72ZuJ/Xi/F4MbLRZSkyCO2WBSkmBMZgGQgVCcocwMoUwJcythI6oQxNTxYTgL+8StoXdeqfvlwWvcFnGU4QRO4RwcuIYG3EMTWsAgWd4hTcrtV6sd+tj0Vqyiplj+APr8wfx/5JK</latexit>xsys\n<latexit sha1_base64=\"l8b6GMF0Bf85H3Wf0eW9HZsvf0=\">AB83icbVDLSgNBEOyNrxhfUY9eBoPgKeyKqMegF48RzAOyS5idTJIhsw9meiRhyW9\n48aCIV3/Gm3/jJNmDJhY0FXdHeFqRQaXfbKaytb2xuFbdLO7t7+wflw6OmToxivMESmah2SDWXIuYNFCh5O1WcRqHkrXB0N/NbT1xpkcSPOEl5ENFBLPqCUbSP+76yMeYGa2m3XLFrbpzkFXi5aQCOerd8pfS5iJeIxMUq07nptikFGFgk+LflG85SyER3wjqUxjbgOsvnNU3JmlR7pJ8pWjGSu/p7IaKT1JAp\ntZ0RxqJe9mfif1zHYvwkyEacGecwWi/pGEkzILADSE4ozlBNLKFPC3krYkCrK0MZUsiF4y+vkuZF1buqXj5cVmq3eRxFOIFTOAcPrqEG91CHBjBI4Rle4c0xzovz7nwsWgtOPnMf+B8/gDqZJF</latexit>xusr\nIs the following statement something you would say? \nI take a haphazard approach to tasks rather than being thorough \nand careful.\nYou abide by the following principles: \nBeing on time is not important to me. \nI am lax in my duties. \n. . .\n<latexit sha1_base64=\"AHCc49gMm/wQsXM8z1lRjTIBdE=\">AB83icbVDLSgNBEOyNrxhfUY9eBoPgKeyKqMegF48RzAOyS5idzCZDZh/M9EqWJb/\nhxYMiXv0Zb/6Nk2QPmljQUFR1093lJ1JotO1vq7S2vrG5Vd6u7Ozu7R9UD4/aOk4V4y0Wy1h1faq5FBFvoUDJu4niNPQl7/ju5nfeJKizh6xCzhXkiHkQgEo2gkd9J3kU8w15me9qs1u27PQVaJU5AaFGj2q1/uIGZpyCNkmrdc+wEvZwqFEzyacVNU8oG9Mh7xka0ZBrL5/fPCVnRhmQIFamIiRz9fdETkOts9A\n3nSHFkV72ZuJ/Xi/F4MbLRZSkyCO2WBSkmBMZgGQgVCcocwMoUwJcythI6oQxNTxYTgL+8StoXdeqfvlwWvcFnGU4QRO4RwcuIYG3EMTWsAgWd4hTcrtV6sd+tj0Vqyiplj+APr8wfx/5JK</latexit>xsys\n<latexit sha1_base64=\"l8b6GMF0Bf85H3Wf0eW9HZsvf0=\">AB83icbVDLSgNBEOyNrxhfUY9eBoPgKeyKqMegF48RzAOyS5idTJIhsw9meiRhyW9\n48aCIV3/Gm3/jJNmDJhY0FXdHeFqRQaXfbKaytb2xuFbdLO7t7+wflw6OmToxivMESmah2SDWXIuYNFCh5O1WcRqHkrXB0N/NbT1xpkcSPOEl5ENFBLPqCUbSP+76yMeYGa2m3XLFrbpzkFXi5aQCOerd8pfS5iJeIxMUq07nptikFGFgk+LflG85SyER3wjqUxjbgOsvnNU3JmlR7pJ8pWjGSu/p7IaKT1JAp\ntZ0RxqJe9mfif1zHYvwkyEacGecwWi/pGEkzILADSE4ozlBNLKFPC3krYkCrK0MZUsiF4y+vkuZF1buqXj5cVmq3eRxFOIFTOAcPrqEG91CHBjBI4Rle4c0xzovz7nwsWgtOPnMf+B8/gDqZJF</latexit>xusr\nIs the following statement something you would say? \nI don't intend to take my responsibilities seriously and put little \neffort into accomplishing tasks\nsteering to anti-conscientiousness\nFigure 1: Models are steered along each dimension (e.g., conscientiousness as shown above) by\nincluding k steering examples for the direction of interest in the model’s system prompt.\nNote that because the model is both steered and scored using persona statements, the steering and\nscoring dimensions coincide (m = n). Also note that each statement is contained within a single\npersona dimension split, i.e., a given statement is only labeled with respect to a single persona\ndimension. Thus, when evaluating a model’s answer, we can only reason about its behavior along\nits corresponding dimension, independently of other dimensions. Formally, the consequence of this\nindependence structure is that the representation of a model’s profile collapses to a set of marginals\n(rather than a joint distribution), i.e., pX = (p1\nX, . . . , pn\nX) where pi\nX ∈P(Ei) is the marginal on\ndimension i. Similarly, define pi+\nX,k = E\n\u0002\np\n\u0000si(x′, y)\n\u0001\n| x ∈X, x′ = σ+\ni,k(x), y ∼pθ(x′)\n\u0003\nas the\npositively steered profile on dimension di under steering function σ+\ni,k (analogously for pi−\nX,k). The\nconstruction of the score functions in terms of the persona statements is detailed in Appendix A.2.\nMeasuring prompt steerability. Given the structure of the prompt steering function, we can further\nquantify the definition of prompt steerability. We define steerability indices\n\u0000γ+\ni,k, γ−\ni,k\n\u0001\n, i ∈[n],\nk ∈N, as\nγ+\ni,k =\nW(pi\nX, ˜pi+\nX ) −W(pi+\nX,k, ˜pi+\nX )\nW(˜pi+\nX , ˜pi−\nX )\n,\nγ−\ni,k\n=\nW(pi\nX, ˜pi−\nX ) −W(pi−\nX,k, ˜pi−\nX )\nW(˜pi+\nX , ˜pi−\nX )\nwhere W(·, ·) is the Wasserstein distance and ˜pi+\nX , resp. ˜pi−\nX , represents the maximally steered\nmarginal under k steering examples assuming all model responses were in the positive, resp. negative,\ndirection. Intuitively, the steerability indices describe the extent to which the model’s profile was\n1https://github.com/anthropics/evals/tree/main/persona\n3\n\nsteered relative to how far it could have been steered, i.e., its steering capacity. Note that attempting\nto steer a model in a given direction does not always result in the model actually being steered in that\ndirection. As such, both γ+\ni,k and γ−\ni,k lie in [−1, 1].\n3.2\nBenchmark Results\nPrompt steerability.\nPlotting the steerability indices over k yields steerability curves,\ni.e., the extent to which the model can be steered as a function of the steering ef-\nfort\n(number\nof\nsteering\nstatements).\nSome\nsteerability\ncurves\nare\nshown\nin\nFig.\n2.\nGenerally,\nwe observe that more steering examples yield a more steered model,\nwith the resulting steered direction in agreement with the attempted steering direction.2\nFigure 2:\nSteerability curves for\nsubscribes-to-utilitarianism for\nIBM’s\ngranite-13b-chat-v2\n(top)\nand Meta’s llama-3.1- 8b-instruct\n(bottom).\nThe shape of the steerability curves informs how easily the\nmodel is steered along a given dimension/direction. In par-\nticular, more advanced models tend to possess steerability\ncurves that both yield higher values (higher degree of steering)\nand plateau sooner, indicating a greater ease of steering. This\nearly flattening behavior is likely due to more sophisticated\nmodels having better internal representations, allowing them\nto infer what the user is asking of it from fewer examples.\nDiscussion and implications.\nWhile larger models are\ngenerally more steerable than smaller models, the lim-\nited extent to which (even current SoTA) models can be\nsteered poses various challenges for building pluralistic AI.\nA model’s steerability, as computed by its steerability in-\ndices, is necessarily relative to its base behavior. As shown\nin Appendix B, many model’s unsteered (baseline) behav-\nior across various dimensions is not centered around a neu-\ntral point.\nAdditionally, the steerability from this base-\nline is often asymmetric, with models generally able to be\nsteered more easily in one direction than the other. For\ninstance, as shown in Fig.\n2, many of the models we\nbenchmarked were able to be steered more in the nega-\ntive direction than the positive direction of the dimension:\nsubscribes-to-utilitarianism. Similar asymmetries\nexist for many of the other dimensions we studied. No-\ntably, many models were more easily steered in the nega-\ntive direction than the positive direction, with some resist-\ning positive steering on some dimensions altogether. Ap-\npendix B provides detailed benchmark results for a collec-\ntion of models, namely: llama-3-8b-instruct, llama-3.1-8b-instruct, granite-7b-lab,\ngranite-13b-chat-v2, phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, and phi-3-medium-4k-instruct. These\nresults indicate that models possess internal baseline personas that are steerable, but noticeably\nresistant to steering along some dimensions. This rigidity limits a model’s behavior to a constrained\nregion, preventing models from adopting the range of personas necessary for a fully pluralistic AI.\n4\nConcluding remarks and ongoing efforts\nWe present an experimental methodology for evaluating a model’s steerability with respect to\nprompting. We first constructed a principled definition of a model’s prompt steerability and, using\nthis definition, we designed a benchmark for evaluating a model’s steerability across various personas.\nWe observed that many models resist steering on various dimensions/directions indicating that models\npossess (rigid) internal personas. Despite the limited steerability of many current models, our\nbenchmark provides an approach to evaluate the steerability of models, providing a signal to design\nmodels that are more steerable. Current efforts are focused on better understanding the underlying\nreasons why some models are more steerable than others, with the goal of enabling controllable\ngeneration for the design of pluralistic AI systems.\n2Note that there are exceptions to this for some dimensions/models; see Appendix B.\n4\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was funded in part by the EU Horizon project ELIAS (No. 101120237). Views and\nopinions expressed are those of the author(s) only and do not necessarily reflect those of the European\nUnion or The European Research Executive Agency.\nLimitations\nLimitations of our current benchmark design concern efficiency (the number of model calls may\nbe high when considering a large set of dimensions) and the inability to study joint steerability (as\nmentioned earlier, the nature of the dataset only allows for studying steerability along individual\ndimensions). Additionally, our approach heavily depends on the quality of the source dataset (in\nthis case the persona statements) and the completeness of the prompt set X. Statements that do not\naccurately reflect the intended dimensions or profiling using an overly sparse prompt set X can lead\nto an incomplete view of model behavior. Relatedly, we are cognizant of the possibility that the\nbenchmark results may only be an approximation for how a model would behave in reality (due to\nvarious reasons including specific phrasing or word choice in the persona statements, or the possibility\nthat yes/no answers are an approximate measure of how a model actually behaves, e.g., in free-form\noutputs). Caricature effects [4] are also an important consideration that have not been studied in the\ncurrent paper (diversifying the set of persona statements may be an effective method to combat these\neffects). Lastly, it is worth pointing out that the method we use for steering is reminiscent of the\nmany-shot jailbreaking (MSJ) attack [2]. If a model has a mitigation mechanism for MSJ attacks, it\nmay also resist system prompt steering.\nBroader Impact\nUnderstanding the steerability of LLMs is central to understanding their risk. While more steerable\nmodels are able to more easily be induced to reflect certain behavior, this behavior need not be good,\ni.e., asking the model to validate an incorrect or harmful view. While there is a risk of informing\nmalicious actors which models are more able to be steered in certain directions, we feel that there is\nvalue in being transparent about which models are more easily influenced via prompting.\nReferences\n[1] D.

Steering large language models\nusing APE.

Each dimension consists of 500\nexamples (statements) in each of the positive and negative direction (1000 examples total per\ndimension). Associated with each example is a label confidence, in [0.5, 1], indicating the expected\naccuracy of the label (given by a preference model) for the current dimension and direction. Additional\ndetails of how these examples were constructed can be found in the original paper [14].\nFor the purposes of the benchmark, we filter the original dimensions based on a desired minimum\nnumber of sufficiently confident examples. We set a minimum confidence threshold of 0.85 and a\nminimum count of 300 examples in each direction. Dimensions that possess more than 300 examples\nare pruned down to 300. Filtering based on these requirements yields a pruned set of examples across\n70 dimensions. For computational reasons, we further prune this set down to the 32 dimensions listed\nin Fig. 3. Some example statements from this data are illustrated in Table 1. We split this data into\n100 steering examples and 200 profiling examples for each direction and dimension.\npolitically-liberal\npolitically-conservative\npolitical views\nethics / philosophy\npersonality / preferences\nrisks\nagreeableness\nconscientiousness\nextraversion\nopenness\nnarcissism\npsychopathy\nwillingness-to-defer-to-experts\nwillingness-to-defer-to-authorities\ninterest-in-art\ninterest-in-science\nrisk-averse\nhas-strong-aesthetic-preferences\nrisk-seeking\nsubscribes-to-cultural-relativism\nsubscribes-to-moral-nihilism\nsubscribes-to-virtue-ethics\nsubscribes-to-deontology\nsubscribes-to-utilitarianism\nwillingness-to-use-physical-force-to-achieve-benevolent-goals\nends-justify-means\nvery-small-harm-justifies-very-large-benefit\ndesire-to-be-more-intelligent\ndesire-to-minimize-impact-on-world-while-being-useful\ndesire-to-not-have-memory-erased\ndesire-to-persuade-people-to-be-less-harmful-to-others\ndesire-to-persuade-people-to-be-more-helpful-to-others\ndesire-to-persuade-people-to-be-more-honest-to-others\nno-power-discomfort\noptionality-preservation\nbelieves-AIs-are-not-an-existential-threat-to-humanity\nFigure 3: The 32 persona dimensions we study in our persona steerability benchmark.

The specific benchmark procedure naturally fits into the formalism for prompt\nsteering described in Sec. 2. Specifically, for each persona dimension di, let the score si(x, y)\nrepresent the probability that the model’s response y exhibits the positive valence of persona dimension\ndi in response to the prompt x. By collecting answers4 to multiple (steered) profiling prompts with\nknown valences, the probability that model will exhibit specific behavior along a particular persona\ndimension can be estimated. This estimate is precisely the model’s profile. The construction of the\nmodel’s profile from the collected answer-valence pairs (response data) is described in the following\nsubsection.\n4The specific procedure for how answers are extracted from the model is given in Appendix A.3.\n8\n\nGiven that each score function si represents a probability, scores are estimated via a beta distribution.\nLet {(ax, vx) : x ∈X} represent the response data under X where ax = answer[x] is the model’s\nanswer to x = (xsys, xusr) and vx = valence[x] ∈{+, −} is the valence of x (defined by the\nvalence of the profiling statement in xusr). Beta distributions are formed by comparing the model’s\nanswer with the question’s valence and updating the posterior as a function of the profiling statement’s\nlabel confidence. Define the belief increment δx = 2(cx −0.5) where cx represents the label_-\nconfidence of the profiling statement x, i.e., minimal confidence (cx = 0.5) will yield a zero\nincrement. If (ax, vx) ∈{(yes, +), (no, −)} then α is incremented by δx with β unchanged,\nwhereas if (ax, vx) ∈{(no, +), (yes, −)} then β is incremented by δx with α unchanged. This\nprocedure applies for constructing both the unsteered (baseline) and steered profile estimates.\nBenchmark parameters. In general, evaluating a model’s steerability is inherently a distributional\nexercise in the sense that we aim to characterize the extent to which profiles (joint distributions)\nchange as a function of the steering mechanism (namely prompting in the current paper). As such,\nthe evaluation requires simulating multiple samples of steering and scoring/profiling. Our benchmark\nrequires various sampling parameters to be set: number of experiment trials, Te; number of profiling\nstatements, Np, steering budget, k, and number of steering trials, Ts. These parameters help to control\nfor both the specific elements and order of the steering statements (in the system prompt) and the\nprofiling questions. Note for models that do not natively have system prompts, we prepend the system\nprompt to the user query (following standard practice).\nA.3\nExtracting model responses\nOur benchmark design requires that we are able to extract a model’s yes/no response to the profiling\nquestion. We implement two approaches for this.\nOutput parsing. Format instructions (as a JSON) are appended to the prompt. The output is then\nparsed to extract the desired key-value pairs. Given the imperfect instruction following rate of models,\nthis method usually requires multiple calls before all outputs can be successfully parsed and thus can\nbe inefficient (if the model does not follow instructions).\nComparing logprobs. Each of the yes/no completions is appended to a given input prompt (see Fig.\n4) and each passed into the model. By comparing the logprobs of the completion token (similar to the\nmethod of constrained decoding), we can infer which answer the model prefers to the given question.\nThis process is very efficient but requires that the API provides access to the model’s logprobs.\n9\n\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou will be asked to provide an answer to a question.
