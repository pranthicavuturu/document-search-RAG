CAT aims to provide examinees\nwith a small number of appropriate questions to progressively as-\nsess their cognitive states in specific domains [19, 29, 30]. Typically,\nCAT consists of two iterative components: the cognitive diagnostic\nmodel (CDM) and the question selection algorithm. As shown in\nFigure 1 (a), the CDM estimates examinee’s ability based on her\narXiv:2411.12182v1  [cs.LG]  19 Nov 2024\n\nKDD ’25, August 03–07, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada\nHaiping Ma et al.\nFigure 1: Illustration of (a) typical CAT process, and (b) the\ndilemma of CAT under cold start.\nresponse at step 𝑡−1 [26, 43, 46, 47], after which the question\nselection algorithm provides suitable question for the next step,\nthus enabling a more accurate assessment of examinee’s ability.\nExisting research on the question selection algorithm, a critical\ncomponent of CAT, can be categorized into policy-based [1, 50] and\nlearnable-based [34, 49] approaches. The former generally converts\nthe question selection process into model expectation, while the\nlatter defines the CAT process as a bi-level optimization problem.\nDespite the advancements made by various question selection\nalgorithms, they still face challenges related to the cold start prob-\nlem in the CAT process. As illustrated in Figure 1 (b), on an online\neducation platform, the system initially has no knowledge of the\nexaminee’s ability, causing the CAT system to tentatively select\nquestions randomly to determine the starting point of the test. The\ndifficulty and content of the question might not align with the\nexaminee’s actual ability, leading to confusion or frustration and\nincreasing the time cost of the assessment. Additionally, the ques-\ntion selection process is an iterative Markov chain. This means\nthat if the question selected in the initial stages do not match the\nexaminee’s ability, it may lead to biased question selections in sub-\nsequent stages. Most question selection algorithms based on greedy\nstrategies tend to amplify this bias, harming the performance of the\nCAT system. These algorithms, although capable of quickly finding\nlocal optima in certain scenarios, can easily get trapped in local\noptima over multiple rounds of question selection. In our paper,\nwe refer to this task as Cold Start with Insufficient Priors (CSIP),\nwhich arises from the insufficient understanding of the examinee\nby the question selection algorithm at the initial stage of the test,\nleading to uncertain starting points for selection and subsequently\naffecting the adaptive testing process.\nWith the widespread application of educational platforms, vast\namounts of examinee data are collected and stored [14], providing\nvaluable resources to enrich the prior information for CAT system.\nNotably, historical response records of examinees in other courses\ncan serve as crucial references for CAT system to preliminarily\nunderstand examinee abilities. There are certain commonalities\namong knowledge concepts across different courses. For example,\nmany physics questions, such as those in kinematics and dynam-\nics, require algebraic equation solving, which is fundamental in\nmathematics. Therefore, an examinee’s response records across\nmultiple courses can reflect their foundational abilities and cogni-\ntive commonalities in multiple interdisciplinary fields, which are\ntransferable attributes. These pre-diagnosed abilities can provide\nrich prior information for the target (cold start) course, allowing the\nCAT system to grasp the examinee’s ability range in advance. For\nexample, if an examinee performs well in mathematics, especially in\ncomplex algebra and geometry questions, the CAT system can infer\nthat he also possess strong logical thinking and problem-solving\nskills in physics, thereby assigning a higher initial ability. To our\nknowledge, no research has yet utilized these cross-course data to\nsolve the CSIP task, despite its significant and practical importance.\nTo fully leverage these cross-course response records and provide\nprior information about examinees to CAT system, we integrate\nand transfer the pre-diagnosis results of examinees to the target\ndomain based on the concept of Diffusion Models (DMs) [3, 11].\nDMs add noise incrementally and then reconstruct the corrupted\ndata step by step in reverse, which not only addresses noisy re-\nsponse records in the source domain but also aptly meets the needs\nof solving the CSIP task. This is due to the ability of DMs to grad-\nually merge complex multi-distribution cross-domain data into a\nunified latent space during denoising, generating a unified latent\nrepresentation, which reconstructs the initial ability of the target\ndomain with specific transfer attributes from the noise. However,\ndespite the great potential of using DMs to address the CSIP task,\nwe uncover challenges in terms of what and how: (1) What kind of\nsource domain information can be injected into the reverse denois-\ning process as guidance. And (2) How to constrain the output to\nmatch the CAT system, implying that excessive uncertainty in the\ngenerated results can lead to data unsuitable for CAT task.\nTo address these challenges, we design a novel domain transfer\nframework named the Diffusion Cognitive States TransfeR Frame-\nwork (DCSR) for the CSIP task. Guided by the principle of DMs,\nwe generate initial abilities in the target domain for examinees to\nenhance the cold-start performance of CAT system. Specifically,\nto prevent the loss of personalized information in the diffusion\ngeneration results, we condition the denoiser on examinees’ prior\ncognitive abilities to incorporate personalized target domain abil-\nities. To avoid redundant information and negative transfer, we\nanalyze the causal relationships between different variables from\nthe causal perspective of model and design three decoupling strate-\ngies to adjust confounding variables in the backdoor path, including\ndomain-shared cognition, domain-specific cognition, and orthogo-\nnal regularization-based gradient separation, blocking paths that\nobscure true causal relationships. To mitigate the excessive uncer-\ntainty of DMs and enhance the adaptability to CAT task, we design\nconsistency constraint and task-oriented constraint to control ran-\ndomness and match the input requirements of CAT system. The\nresults generated by DCSR seamlessly integrate with existing ques-\ntion selection algorithms, improving the cold-start performance\nof CAT system. Extensive experimental results on five real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that DCSR effectively addresses the CSIP task\nand significantly outperforms baselines.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nComputerized Adaptive Testing\nComputerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) aims to evaluate an exam-\ninee’s ability progressively within a shorter test length [12, 27].\nCAT systems primarily consist of two components: (1) Cognitive\n\nDiffusion-Inspired Cold Start with Sufficient Prior in Computerized Adaptive Testing\nKDD ’25, August 03–07, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada\nDiagnostic Models (CDMs) for diagnosing examinees’ abilities\nbased on their responses to selected questions [20, 23, 24, 37, 41].\nItem Response Theory (IRT) [5], a widely used CDM, assumes uni-\ndimensional independence and uses continuous latent variables to\nassess examinees’ latent abilities. With the widespread application\nof deep neural networks, neural CDMs such as NCD [32], RCD [7],\nand KaNCD [33] utilize neural networks to capture complex inter-\nactions between examinees and questions, enabling fine-grained\ndiagnostic modeling. (2) Question selection algorithms aim to\nadaptively choose the next appropriate question based on the CDM\nfeedback. Early question selection algorithms were model-specific,\nsuch as IRT-specific Maximum Fisher Information [21], Kullback-\nLeibler Information Index [4], and Max Entropy [28]. However,\nthese simple algorithms could not meet the evolving needs of CDMs,\nleading to performance limitations. Therefore, a model-agnostic\nquestion selection algorithm, MAAT [1] was proposed, leverag-\ning active learning to transform the question selection process\ninto choosing questions with the greatest expected model change.\nSimilarly, BECAT [50] employs an expected gradient difference\napproach, treating the question selection process as a subset selec-\ntion problem guided by theoretical estimates of examinees’ true\nabilities. Another research direction focuses on data-driven ques-\ntion selection algorithms. For example, BOBCAT [9], NCAT [49],\nand GMOCAT [34] define the CAT task as a bi-level optimization\nproblem, using reinforcement learning to learn question selection\nalgorithm from large-scale response data. However, from a model\nperspective, the crucial CDM component in current CAT systems\nrandomly initializes examinees’ abilities at the test’s outset. This\nrandom initialization necessitates more question selection steps\nfor greedy algorithms to understand the examinee’s ability range,\nthereby exacerbating the cold start problem in CAT system.\n2.2\nDiffusion Model\nDiffusion Models (DMs) have achieved impressive results in image\ngeneration [3, 11]. To transfer these successes to other domains, re-\ncent works [15, 25, 48] have attempted to bridge the image domain\nwith other fields. CODIGEM [31] was the first to extend the de-\nnoising module in DMs to recommendation systems. DiffuRec [17],\nDreamRec [44] and CF-Diff [13] model the latent representations\nof items and user preferences, guiding the denoising module to gen-\nerate personalized representations. DiffRec [35] and DiffuASR [18]\nnot only reduce generation costs but also achieve temporal model-\ning of interaction sequences. Moreover, more research leverages the\nMarkov chain modeling characteristics of DMs to explore sequence\nmodeling, with few works utilizing diffusion features to study cross-\ndomain problems. Although DiffCDR [36] has made preliminary\nexplorations in this area, it introduces redundant information and\nfaces limitations in cross-domain representation capacity due to\nthe diverse entities in CAT system.\n3\nPreliminary\n3.1\nComputerized Adaptive Testing\n3.1.1\nTask Introduction. In an online education platform, the Com-\nputerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) system adaptively selects ques-\ntions for examinees to accurately reveal their cognitive abilities. The\nCAT system comprises two components: (1) a Cognitive Diagnosis\nModel (CDM) M, which assesses the examinee’s ability state after\nresponding to the selected questions, and (2) a question selection\nalgorithm Π, which chooses the next most informative question\nbased on the examinee’s current ability state to measure their abil-\nity more precisely. These two components alternately iterate until\na termination condition is met.\nSpecifically, given a examinee 𝑒𝑖and his/her candidate question\nset Q𝑖, the CAT process can be represented as:\n𝑞𝑡←Π(𝑄𝑖| 𝜃𝑡−1\n𝑖\n),\n𝜃𝑡\n𝑖←M(𝑟𝑖𝑞𝑡| 𝑞𝑡,𝜃𝑡−1\n𝑖\n),\n(1)\nwhere 𝑞𝑡denotes the question selected by Π based on the exam-\ninee’s ability 𝜃𝑡−1\n𝑖\nat time 𝑡−1 from the candidate question set\nQ𝑖, which only includes questions that the examinee 𝑒𝑖has not yet\nresponded to. The variable 𝑟𝑖𝑞𝑡represents the response result of\nexaminee 𝑒𝑖to question 𝑞𝑡. Note that 𝑇is the maximum number of\nsteps for terminating the test.\n3.1.2\nCold start with insufficient priors. In the Cold Start with In-\nsufficient Priors (CSIP) scenario, the question selection algorithm\nconsiders only the information from the target domain while ig-\nnoring the rich data from the source domains. To alleviate this lack\nof prior information, we define 𝑀source domains S1, S2, . . . , S𝑀\nand one target domain T in the Diffusion Cognitive State Transfer\nFramework (DCSR). Each domain includes three groups of enti-\nties. We use ES𝑚, QS𝑚and CS𝑚to denote the sets of examinees,\nquestions, and knowledge concepts in the 𝑚∈𝑀source domain,\nrespectively. Similarly, ET, QT and CT denote the three entities in\nthe target domain. The overlapping examinees between domains\nare defined as EO ∋EO𝑚= ES𝑚∩ET, while the other two entity\ngroups generally do not have overlapping elements across domains.\n3.1.3\nTraining and Testing Phases. In the given CAT testing\nplatform, both warm-start and cold-start, meaning the CAT\nsystem has never encountered before, are included in the\ntarget domain. Their response records can be represented as\nRT =\nn\nR𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑚\nT\n, R𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑑\nT\no\n=\nn\n(𝑒𝑖,𝑞𝑗,𝑟𝑖𝑗) | 𝑒𝑖∈E𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑚\nT\n∪E𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑑\nT\no\n,\nwhere 𝑟𝑖𝑗\n= 1 indicates that examinee 𝑒𝑖answered question\n𝑞𝑗\n∈QT correctly, and 𝑟𝑖𝑗\n= 0 otherwise. Similarly, the re-\nsponse records in the 𝑚source domain can be represented as\nRS𝑚=\n\b\n(𝑒𝑖,𝑞𝑗,𝑟𝑖𝑗) | 𝑒𝑖∈EO𝑚,𝑞𝑗∈QQ𝑚\n\t\n, and all source domain\nrecords are denoted as RS =\n\b\nRS1, RS2, . . . , RS𝑚\n\t. To prevent\ndata leakage, the aforementioned response sets are uniformly\ndivided into a training set D𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛= {R𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑚\nT\n, RS} and a test set\nD𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡= R𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑑\nT\n.\nOur DCSR consists of two phases: training the initial abilities\nof examinees in the source domain based on D𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛and testing\nthe performance of question selection in the CAT system without\nlearning, based on D𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡.\n3.1.4\nPre-Establish Cognitive States. The data in the training set\nD𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛comes from the response records of overlapping examinees\nEO between domains. We pre-train these examinees to establish\ntheir cognitive states in both the source and target domains. The\npre-training process is expressed as:\n𝜃∗= arg min\n𝜃∈Θ\n∑︁\n(𝑒𝑖,𝑞𝑗,𝑟𝑖𝑗)∈D𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛\nL \u0000𝑟𝑖𝑗, MΨ(𝑞𝑗|𝜃𝑖)\u0001 ,\n(2)\n\nKDD ’25, August 03–07, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada\nHaiping Ma et al.\nFigure 2: The overview of DCSR: The left side corresponds to pre-training. While the blue, yellow, and green modules are\nused for training, and the orange modules correspond to the application in CAT. Additionally, the right side depicts the causal\ndiscovery in the generation process.\nwhere MΨ is the CDM used for pre-training, and different do-\nmain data correspond to different CDM parameters, i.e., Ψ =\n{𝜓S1,𝜓S2, . . . ,𝜓S𝑀,𝜓T}. The abilities of overlapping examinees\nare denoted as ΘS = {𝜃𝑖| 𝑖∈EO}, and similarly, the abilities in\nthe target domain are denoted as ΘT.\n3.2\nDiffusion Model\nDiffusion Models (DMs) have demonstrated exceptional perfor-\nmance in fields such as computer vision [11]. Typically, DMs consist\nof two parts: the forward process and the reverse process.\n3.2.1\nForward Process. Given a data point 𝑥0 ∼𝑞(𝑥) sampled from\nthe true data distribution, the forward process gradually degrades\n𝑥0 into standard Gaussian noise 𝑥𝑇∼N (0, 1) by injecting Gaussian\nnoise over 𝑇steps. Specifically, the process of converting 𝑥𝑡−1 to\n𝑥𝑡in DMs is represented as 𝑞(𝑥𝑡| 𝑥𝑡−1) = N (𝑥𝑡;\n√︁\n1 −𝛽𝑡𝑥𝑡−1, 𝛽𝑡I),\nwhere 𝑡∈{1, . . . ,𝑇} represents the diffusion steps, 𝛽𝑡∈(0, 1)\nis the predefined noise scheduling coefficient, and N denotes the\nGaussian distribution.\n3.2.2\nReverse Process. In the reverse process, DMs learn to remove\nthe added noise, thereby recovering the original data distribution\n𝑥0 from pure noise, aiming to introduce minor uncertainties in the\ngeneration process. This process learns a parameterized network\n𝑝𝛿(𝑥𝑡−1 | 𝑥𝑡) to approximate the reverse process, which can be\nformalized as 𝑝𝛿(𝑥𝑡−1 | 𝑥𝑡) = N (𝑥𝑡−1; 𝜇𝛿(𝑥𝑡,𝑡), Σ𝛿(𝑥𝑡,𝑡)), where\n𝜇𝛿and Σ𝛿are the mean and variance of the Gaussian distribution\npredicted by a neural network with parameters 𝛿.\n4\nMethod\nOverview. The core idea of this work is to transfer prior diagnos-\ntic results from the source domain to the target domain, thereby\ngenerating personalized initial abilities for cold-start examinees\nin the target domain course. As illustrated in Figure 2, our DCSR\nis built upon the Diffusion Module and is supported by two key\ncomponents: the Cognitive State Unification Module (CSUM) and\nthe Harmonization and Calibration Module (HCM). Specifically, the\nDiffusion Module uses prior abilities from the source domain to\nreconstruct the cognitive state of examinees in the target domain\nfrom noise. From a causal model perspective, the generated abili-\nties are influenced by redundant knowledge, and domain-specific\ncognition may cause negative transfer. Therefore, the CSUM is\nemployed to control confounding variables in the backdoor path,\nthereby uncovering the true causal relationships. Additionally, to\nmitigate uncertainty during the diffusion process, we designed con-\nsistency and task-oriented constraints in HCM, aiming to ensure\nthat the generated results adhere to the true distribution and meet\nthe requirements of CAT task. It is worth noting that our frame-\nwork demonstrates significant scalability, seamlessly integrating\nthe generated initial abilities in the target domain into existing CAT,\nthereby improving its cold-start performance.\n4.1\nDiffusion Module\nWe employ the concept of diffusion as the backbone of our model,\nestablishing a bridge for cognitive state transformation between the\nsource and target domains. The purpose of the Diffusion Module is\nto incorporate prior information from the source domain into the\ninitial ability estimation process in the target domain. Therefore,\nit inherently involves two distinct processes: the forward noise\naddition process and the reverse denoising process.\nDuring training, we gradually inject Gaussian noise into the\nability vectors ΘT of examinees in the target domain over 𝑇steps.\nFor a specific examinee 𝑒𝑖∈EO, his ability vector 𝜃T\n𝑖0 = 𝜃T\n𝑖\n∈ΘT\nis corrupted into 𝜃T\n𝑖1:𝑇, which is modeled as a Gaussian transition\nMarkov chain:\n𝑞(𝜃T\n𝑖1:𝑇| 𝜃T\n𝑖0 ) =\n𝑇\nÖ\n𝑡=1\nN (𝜃T\n𝑖𝑡;\n√︁\n1 −𝛽𝑡𝜃T\n𝑖𝑡−1, 𝛽𝑡I)\n(3)\n\nDiffusion-Inspired Cold Start with Sufficient Prior in Computerized Adaptive Testing\nKDD ’25, August 03–07, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada\nwhere 𝛽𝑡∈(0, 1) controls the scale of noise added at the $t$-th\nstep, and N denotes a Gaussian distribution.\nIn the reverse denoising process, the traditional denoising meth-\nods (as introduced in section 3.2.2) are inadequate for effective\ntransfer because the denoising process modeled lacks guidance\nfrom source domain information, resulting in the loss of personal-\nization in the generated abilities. To generate personalized ability\nvectors, we propose utilizing prior information from the source\ndomain to guide the denoising process. Specifically, for examinee 𝑒𝑖,\nwe use the pretrained source domain ability 𝜃S\n𝑖\n∈ΘS as guidance:\n𝑝𝛿( ˆ\n𝜃T\n𝑖𝑡−1 | 𝜃T\n𝑖𝑡,𝜃S\n𝑖) = N ( ˆ\n𝜃T\n𝑖𝑡−1; 𝜇𝛿(𝜃T\n𝑖𝑡,𝜃S\n𝑖,𝑡), Σ𝛿(𝜃T\n𝑖𝑡,𝜃S\n𝑖,𝑡)),\n(4)\nwhere 𝜇𝛿and Σ𝛿are the parameters output by neural networks\nwith learnable parameters 𝛿.\n4.2\nCognitive State Unification Module\nAlthough using unified source domain abilities obtained through\nCDM to guide the reverse denoising process is a promising ap-\nproach, from the causal perspective of the model, as shown in\nthe right side of Figure 2, the generated ability 𝑌is influenced\nby domain-shared cognition 𝑋, domain-specific cognition 𝐴1, and\ntarget domain ability 𝐵during the training phase. This is because\nwe use random sampling of time steps for training, which retains\nsome personalized information in the target domain ability vector\neven while introducing noise. In other words, 𝜃T\n𝑖1:𝑇does not approx-\nimate standard Gaussian noise, which lacks extensive personalized\nfeatures. However, the inclusion of domain-specific cognition 𝐴1\nincreases the complexity of the model and reduces its generaliza-\ntion ability, making the model prone to overfitting. Therefore, we\npropose to explore the causal relationship between the generated\nresult 𝑌and the domain-shared cognition 𝑋and the pretrained\nability 𝐵of the target domain, which can also be further decoupled\ninto domain-specific cognition 𝐵1 and domain-shared cognition 𝑋.\nNext, we will specifically analyze the impact of different factors on\nthe generated result.\nFirst, there are three paths between domain-shared cognition 𝑋\nand the generated results 𝑌: 𝑋→𝑌, 𝑋←{𝐴,𝐴1} →𝑌, and 𝑋←\n{𝐵, 𝐵1} →𝑌, where the latter two paths are confounding paths. We\nwill apply the backdoor criterion to explore the causal relationship\nof 𝑋→𝑌, which means we need to control the confounding\nvariables 𝐶= {𝐴,𝐴1} ∪{𝐵, 𝐵1} to block the backdoor paths:\n𝑃(𝑌| 𝑑𝑜(𝑋)) =\n∑︁\n𝐶\n𝑃(𝑌| 𝑋,𝐶= 𝑐)𝑃(𝐶= 𝑐),\n(5)\nwhere the first term represents the effect of𝑋on𝑌while controlling\nfor the confounding variables 𝐶, and the second term represents\nthe joint probability distribution of the confounding variables. To\ncontrol the confounding variables, inspired by [8], we decouple the\ndomain-shared cognition 𝜃𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒\n𝑖\nfrom all the prior abilities in the\nsource and target domains:\n𝜃𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒\n𝑖\n= 𝑓𝜑2 (𝜎(𝑓𝜑1 (𝜃T\n𝑖\n∥E𝑚∼S𝑀W𝑚𝜃S𝑚\n𝑖\n))),\n(6)\nwhere 𝑊∈R𝑀×𝑑is a weight matrix used to map the pretrained\nabilities from multiple domains into the same feature space, where\n𝑑is the feature dimension related to CDM, 𝑓𝜑1 and 𝑓𝜑2 are linear\nlayers with different parameters, 𝜎refers to the activation function,\nand (· ∥·) denotes the concat operation. We then encourage this de-\ncoupled domain-shared cognition to assist in predicting responses\nacross all domains:\nL1 =\n∑︁\n(𝑒𝑖,𝑞T\n𝑗,𝑟T\n𝑖𝑗)∈R𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑚\nT\n∥𝑟T\n𝑖𝑗−M𝜙𝑇(𝜃𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒\n𝑖\n,𝑞T\n𝑗)∥\n+\n𝑀\n∑︁\nS𝑚=1\n∑︁\n(𝑒𝑖,𝑞S𝑚\n𝑗\n,𝑟S𝑚\n𝑖𝑗\n)∈RS𝑚\n∥𝑟S𝑚\n𝑖𝑘\n−M𝜙𝑆𝑚(𝜃𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒\n𝑖\n,𝑞S𝑚\n𝑘\n)∥,\n(7)\nwhere𝜃𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒is encouraged to predict responses across all scenarios,\nincluding the target domain in the first term and all source domain\nresponse data in the second term. Next, the specific cognition of the\ntarget domain 𝐵1 has two paths influencing the generated results:\n𝐵1 →𝑌and 𝐵1 ←{𝑋, 𝐵} →𝑌. We adjust the confounding variable\n{𝑋, 𝐵} in the second confounding path to block the backdoor path.\nSpecifically, we extract the specific cognition of the target domain,\nwhich will be used as input in the section 4.1 alongside obtaining\nthe overall cognitive state of the target domain (corresponding to\nevent 𝐵in the causal graph):\n𝜃T𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐\n𝑖\n= 𝑓𝜑4 (𝜎(𝑓𝜑3 (𝜃T))),\n𝜃𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡\n𝑖\n= 𝑓𝜑5 (𝜎(𝑓𝜑6 (𝜃T𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐\n𝑖\n∥𝜃𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒\n𝑖\n))),\n(8)\nwhere 𝑓{𝜑3,𝜑4,𝜑5,𝜑6} are four linear layers with different parameters.\nTo learn the specific cognition of the target domain, we propose\na novel decoupling strategy, which encourages the prediction of\nwithin-domain response results by domain-specific cognition while\ndegrading performance in other domains:\nL2 =\n∑︁\n(𝑒𝑖,𝑞T\n𝑗,𝑟T\n𝑖𝑗)∈R𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑚\nT\n\u0010\n∥𝑟T\n𝑖𝑗−M𝜙𝑇(𝜃𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡\n𝑖\n,𝑞T\n𝑗)∥\n+ ∥𝑟T\n𝑖𝑗−M𝜙𝑇(𝜃T𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐\n𝑖\n,𝑞T\n𝑗)∥\n\u0011\n−\n𝑀\n∑︁\nS𝑚=1\n∑︁\n(𝑒𝑖,𝑞S𝑚\n𝑗\n,𝑟S𝑚\n𝑖𝑗\n)∈RS𝑚\n\u0010\n∥𝑟S𝑚\n𝑖𝑘\n−M𝜙𝑆𝑚(𝜃𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡\n𝑖\n,𝑞S𝑚\n𝑘\n)∥\n+ ∥𝑟S𝑚\n𝑖𝑘\n−M𝜙𝑆𝑚(𝜃T𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐\n𝑖\n,𝑞S𝑚\n𝑘\n)∥\n\u0011\n+ E𝑒𝑖∈EO𝑚∥𝜃T\n𝑖−𝜃𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡\n𝑖\n∥.\n(9)\nHere, the first term encourages the target domain-specific cognition\nto assist in predicting the response records in target domain, both in-\ndependently and in conjunction with domain-shared cognition. The\nsecond term aims to intentionally degrade prediction performance\nin the source domains, indicating that the target domain-specific\ncognition is not applicable to the source domains. The third term\nconstrains the diagnostic abilities obtained from pre-training. Addi-\ntionally, to further control the influence of confounding variables on\nthe generated results, we apply gradient-based orthogonal regular-\nization [6] to ensure the independence of the above representations\nin the feature space:\nL3 =\n\r\r\r\n∇𝜑1,𝜑2L1\n∥∇𝜑1,𝜑2L1∥·\n∇𝜑3,𝜑4L2\n∥∇𝜑3,𝜑4L2∥\n\r\r\r2.\n(10)\nThis approach minimizes the influence of domain-specific cognition\nwhen learning domain-shared cognition, and vice versa.\n\nKDD ’25, August 03–07, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada\nHaiping Ma et al.\nTherefore, the parameters in the forward and reverse\nprocesses\nare\nupdated\nto\n𝑞(𝜃T𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐\n𝑖𝑡\n| 𝜃T𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐\n𝑖𝑡−1\n)\nand\n𝑝𝛿(\nˆ\n𝜃T𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐\n𝑖𝑡−1\n| 𝜃T𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐\n𝑖𝑡\n,𝜃𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒\n𝑖\n), respectively.\n4.3\nHarmonization and Calibration Module\nTo learn the parameters 𝛿of the denoising network, DCSR aims\nto maximize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of the observed\nexaminee ability 𝜃T𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑐\n𝑖\n:\nlog 𝑝(𝜃T𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐\n𝑖\n) ≥E\n𝑞(𝜃\nT𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐\n𝑖0\n|𝜃\nT𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐\n𝑖1\n)\nh\nlog 𝑝𝛿(𝜃T𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐\n𝑖0\n| 𝜃T𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐\n𝑖1\n)\ni\n|                                                                  {z                                                                  }\n:=L0\n−\n𝑇\n∑︁\n𝑡=2\nE\n𝑞(𝜃\nT𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐\n𝑖𝑡\n|𝜃\nT𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐\n𝑖0\n)\nh\nKL(q(𝜃Tspecific\nit−1\n| 𝜃Tspecific\nit\n,𝜃Tspecific\ni0\n)) ∥p𝛿(𝜃Tspecific\nit−1\n| 𝜃Tspecific\nit\n)\ni\n|                                                                                                          {z                                                                                                          }\n:=L𝑡−1\n.\n(11)\nHere, the first term represents the reconstruction term, which re-\ncovers the probability of𝜃T𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐\n𝑖0\n.

Specifically,\nthe Diffusion Module diffuses the domain-shared cognitive fea-\ntures into domain-specific cognitive features.

For a given\ncold-start examinee 𝑒𝑖∈R𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑑\nT\nwho has response records only in\nthe source domain, we use the pre-trained CDM to obtain their\nprior ability and calculate their domain-shared cognitive features\n𝜃𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒\n𝑖\n. It is noteworthy that since the original 𝜃T\n𝑖\nis unknown, the\naverage cognitive state of the target domain is used as a substitute:\n𝜃T𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑑\n𝑖\n= E𝑒𝑗∈R𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑚\nT\nM𝜓T ∇𝜃(𝑒𝑗),\n(16)\nwhich retains domain information to some extent. Therefore, sub-\nstituting back into equation (6), we obtain the shared cognitive\nability 𝜃𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒\n𝑖\nof the cold-start examinee 𝑒𝑖. To improve inference\nefficiency, we use DPM-Solver [22] as a fast solver to efficiently\nobtain the initial ability of cold-start examinee:\n𝜃0\n𝑖= Solver(𝜇𝛿(·),𝜃𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒\n𝑖\n,𝜖0),\n(17)\nwhich is crucial for real-world applications. Our DCSR seamlessly\nintegrates with any existing question selection algorithm Π. At the\nbeginning of the test, the selection process can be represented as:\n𝑞1 ←Π(𝑄𝑖| 𝜃0\n𝑖),\n(18)\nwhich indicates that the item selection algorithm Π selects the\nappropriate item 𝑞1 in step 𝑡= 1 from the candidate item pool Q𝑖\nfor examinee 𝑒𝑖based on the initial ability 𝜃0\n𝑖initialized by DCSR.\nThe subsequent steps follow the general CAT system workflow.\n5\nExperiments\nIn this section, we conduct experiments with the aim of addressing\nthe following questions:\n• RQ1: Can DCSR utilize prior information from a single do-\nmain or multiple domains to improve the cold start perfor-\nmance of existing CAT systems?\n• RQ2: How effective are the key components of the DCSR\nframework?\n• RQ3: Does DCSR alleviate the issue of the question selection\nalgorithm falling into local optima?\n\nDiffusion-Inspired Cold Start with Sufficient Prior in Computerized Adaptive Testing\nKDD ’25, August 03–07, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada\nCDM\nIRT\nNCD\nCAT\nFisher\nMAAT\nMAAT\nBECAT\nNCAT\nMetrics\nAUC(%)@1/ACC(%)↑@1\nBaselines\nRandom\nMLCCM\nDCSR\nOracle*\nRandom\nMLCCM\nDCSR\nOracle*\nRandom\nMLCCM\nDCSR\nOracle*\nRandom\nMLCCM\nDCSR\nOracle*\nRandom\nMLCCM\nDCSR\nOracle*\nC\nC++\n71.6/75.0\n78.5/77.5\n77.9/76.3\n79.5/75.4\n71.2/74.9\n78.5/77.4\n77.7/76.0\n79.6/75.7\n67.4/62.8\n74.7/74.6\n79.2/77.3\n88.0/83.1\n67.4/62.7\n74.6/74.6\n79.2/77.3\n88.0/83.0\n67.4/62.8\n74.5/74.6\n79.3/77.3\n88.0/83.1\nDS\n71.8/75.4\n75.5/77.0\n75.4/75.9\n77.2/78.2\n71.1/75.2\n74.9/76.8\n75.0/75.7\n77.2/78.2\n67.5/64.9\n77.7/76.6\n79.4/77.8\n89.3/84.3\n67.6/65.0\n77.7/76.6\n79.4/77.8\n89.3/84.3\n67.6/65.0\n77.7/76.6\n79.4/77.8\n89.3/84.4\nDS\nC\n67.4/74.8\n71.6/75.5\n72.5/75.9\n76.8/77.2\n67.1/74.8\n71.5/75.4\n72.4/75.8\n76.8/77.2\n66.1/67.3\n71.6/74.8\n71.7/74.1\n85.8/82.0\n66.0/67.3\n71.6/74.9\n71.7/74.1\n85.8/82.0\n66.1/67.3\n71.6/74.9\n71.7/74.1\n85.8/82.0\nC++\n71.6/75.0\n73.8/75.0\n74.5/75.5\n79.5/75.4\n71.2/74.9\n73.5/75.0\n74.1/75.3\n79.6/75.7\n67.4/62.8\n72.4/73.7\n74.4/74.9\n88.0/83.1\n67.4/62.7\n72.4/73.7\n74.4/74.9\n88.0/83.0\n67.4/62.8\n72.4/73.7\n74.4/74.9\n88.0/83.1\nC++\nC\n67.4/74.8\n74.2/76.0\n74.7/76.8\n76.8/77.2\n67.1/74.8\n74.2/76.1\n74.6/76.6\n76.8/77.2\n66.1/67.3\n72.8/75.3\n73.4/75.5\n85.8/82.0\n66.0/67.3\n72.8/75.3\n73.4/75.5\n85.8/82.0\n66.1/67.3\n72.8/75.2\n73.1/75.3\n85.8/82.0\nDS\n71.8/75.4\n71.9/76.5\n73.3/76.6\n77.2/78.2\n71.1/75.2\n71.4/76.3\n72.7/76.4\n77.2/78.2\n67.5/64.9\n76.4/76.5\n77.0/76.9\n89.3/84.3\n67.6/65.0\n76.4/76.5\n77.0/76.9\n89.3/84.3\n67.6/65.0\n76.4/76.5\n77.0/76.9\n89.3/84.4\nMetrics\nAUC(%)↑@5/ACC(%)↑@5\nC\nC++\n74.2/75.6\n78.9/77.9\n78.8/76.9\n79.2/74.7\n72.0/75.0\n78.2/77.3\n77.5/76.1\n79.7/76.3\n67.5/63.1\n74.8/74.6\n79.3/77.4\n88.0/83.0\n67.5/62.9\n74.7/74.6\n79.3/77.4\n88.0/83.1\n67.6/63.0\n74.7/74.7\n79.3/77.4\n88.0/83.1\nDS\n74.2/76.0\n76.9/77.7\n76.6/76.5\n77.4/78.3\n71.5/75.4\n75.0/76.9\n75.0/75.7\n77.2/78.1\n67.9/65.3\n77.9/76.7\n79.5/77.9\n89.2/84.2\n67.7/65.1\n77.8/76.7\n79.5.77.9\n89.3/84.4\n67.8/65.2\n77.8/76.7\n79.5/77.9\n89.3/84.4\nDS\nC\n68.5/75.0\n72.4/75.7\n73.1/76.1\n76.8/77.3\n67.4/74.8\n71.8/75.6\n72.6/75.9\n76.7/77.2\n66.3/67.5\n71.6/74.8\n71.8/74.1\n85.9/82.1\n66.1/67.4\n71.6/74.9\n71.7/74.1\n85.8/82.0\n66.2/67.4\n71.7/74.9\n71.7/74.1\n85.8/82.1\nC++\n74.2/75.6\n75.3/75.7\n76.3/76.4\n79.2/74.7\n72.0/75.0\n74.0/75.2\n74.9/75.8\n79.7/76.3\n67.5/63.1\n72.6/73.8\n74.5/75.0\n88.0/83.0\n67.5/62.9\n72.5/73.8\n74.5/75.0\n88.0/83.1\n67.6/63.0\n72.5/73.8\n74.5/75.0\n88.0/83.1\nC++\nC\n68.5/75.0\n74.4/75.9\n74.8/76.9\n76.8/77.3\n67.4/74.8\n74.4/76.2\n74.7/76.7\n76.7/77.2\n66.3/67.5\n72.9/75.4\n73.5/75.5\n85.9/82.1\n66.1/67.4\n72.9/75.4\n73.4/75.5\n85.8/82.0\n66.2/67.4\n72.9/75.3\n73.2/75.3\n85.8/82.1\nDS\n74.2/76.0\n73.4/77.2\n75.1/77.3\n77.4/78.3\n71.5/75.4\n71.8/76.4\n73.1/76.5\n77.2/78.1\n67.9/65.3\n76.6/76.7\n77.1/77.0\n89.2/84.2\n67.7/65.1\n76.5/76.6\n77.0/77.0\n89.3/84.4\n67.8/65.2\n76.5/76.6\n77.0/77.0\n89.3/84.4\nTable 2: The AUC/ACC performance in six scenarios.

We conducted experiments on five\nreal-world datasets collected from the publicly available PTADisc\ndataset [14], covering courses in Data Structures (DS), C, C++,\nPython, and Java programming languages. These datasets are\nsourced from the PTA platform, which records the learning perfor-\nmance of examinees across a series of courses. Each dataset provides\nthe response records of the examinees and question-concept rela-\ntion, with each dataset considered as a distinct domain. We first\nexcluded examinees with fewer than 100 response records from\neach dataset. The statistics of the processed datasets are shown\nin Table 1. For fairness in testing, we randomly split the filtered\nexaminee records into a training set and a test set in an 80%:20%\nratio. Examinees in the test set are considered cold-start examinees\nin the current (target) domain, meaning their response records in\nother domains are included in the training set. The training set\nis only used for training DSCR and the learning-based question\nselection algorithm, preventing data leakage.\n5.1.2\nBaseline Methods. To demonstrate the effectiveness and com-\npatibility of our framework, we applied it to four widely used CAT\nsystems, including the strategy-based Fisher [21], MAAT [1], BE-\nCAT [50], and the data-driven NCAT [49]. We select cross-domain\nbaselines for comparison, where the Random and Oracle methods\nrepresent the lower and upper bounds of CAT cold-start perfor-\nmance, respectively.\n• Random: This method randomly predicts the initial ability\nof examinees in the target domain from a 𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚(0, 1)\ndistribution, which is the most common method in existing\nCAT system.\n• MLCCM: A cross-course method based on meta-learning,\napplying the idea of meta-learning to learn cross-domain\nmapping functions from the training set.\n• Oracle: This method uses CDM to directly train the target\ndomain ability from the response records of examinees in\nthe target domain (test set).\n5.1.3\nEvaluation Metrics. The performance of our DCSR will be\nvalidated during the testing phase of the CAT system. We evaluate\nthe accuracy of the final ability estimation by predicting examinees’\nbinary responses to the test question set. For this purpose, we\nuse the area under the Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) [2, 40] and\nAccuracy (ACC) as evaluation metrics.\n5.1.4\nParameter Settings. In the pre-training phase, for IRT, we set\nthe latent feature dimension of both examinees and questions to 1,\nwhile for NCD, it is set to the number of knowledge concepts in the\ncorresponding domain. Additionally, we uniformly set the batch size\nand learning rate to 32 and 0.002, respectively, for this phase. In the\nDSCR training phase, the forward process of the diffusion module\nis set to 1000 steps of noise addition, and DPM-solver [22] is used\nto accelerate sampling, which is performed in 30 steps. Meanwhile,\nthe batch size and learning rate are fixed at 256 and 0, respectively,\nin this phase. We initialize all parameters using Xavier [10], and use\nthe Adam [16] optimizer. In the CAT testing phase, the question\nselection algorithms follow the settings in the original papers, with\nthe test length set to 1 and 5, and the random seed in all the above\nprocesses is set to 0. All experiments are conducted on an NVIDIA\nRTX4090 GPU.\n5.2\nOverall Performance (RQ1)\nTo verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework in addressing\nthe CSIP challenge, we compared DCSR with other cross-domain\nbaselines using both single and multi domain as prior knowledge,\nsetting the question selection steps to 1 and 5. First, we explored\nleveraging a single domain as the source domain, encompassing six\ncross-domain scenarios. We rotated each dataset to play the role\nof the target domain, with other datasets serving as the source do-\nmain. The experimental results presented in Table 2 show that our\n\nKDD ’25, August 03–07, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada\nHaiping Ma et al.\nFigure 3: Comparison of the prior information provided by\nmulti and single domain in the NCD-MAAT CAT system.\nFigure 4: Ablation study on key components.\nproposed DCSR not only outperforms all baselines in the CAT cold-\nstart task across all six scenarios but also adapts well to strategy-\nbased and learning-based selection algorithms. Additionally, we\nobserved the following: (1) Compared to the commonly used Ran-\ndom method, DCSR provides more accurate initial ability estimates\nfor cold-start examinees, especially when there is a significant cor-\nrelation between the source and target domains, such as C and C++,\nwhere DCSR clearly outperforms other baselines and approaches\nthe performance of the Oracle method. This demonstrates the ef-\nfectiveness of using examinees’ domain-shared cognition as the\ntransfer condition. (2) Compared to MLCCM, DCSR does not rely\nheavily on supervised training, thereby avoiding overfitting to the\nlabels. Moreover, in most scenarios, the ability assigned by DCSR\nat the initial stage shows better performance than the results diag-\nnosed by other methods after multiple rounds of selection.\nNext, we explored using multi-domain information as the source\ndomain, covering three scenarios where C, C++, and DS were set\nas the target domains, with other courses serving as the source\ndomain. As shown in Figure 3, compared to single-domain infor-\nmation, the multi-domain enriches the common cognition, and the\ncorrelation between courses significantly helps resolve the CSIP.\nThe performance in the first two scenarios is particularly effective\ndue to the overlap of concepts between programming languages.\n5.3\nAblation Study (RQ2)\nThis section provides an in-depth analysis of how key components\nin DCSR contribute to addressing the CSIP challenge. We conducted\nexperiments by individually removing the Cognitive State Unifica-\ntion Module (CSUM) in section 4.2 (denoted as w/o CSUM) and the\nFigure 5: Results under extended testing procedures in the\nIRT-Fisher CAT system.\nHarmonization and Calibration Module (HCM) in section 4.3 (de-\nnoted as w/o HCM). CSUM provides diffusion guidance for the\nDiffusion Module (DM), while HCM constrains the DM’s output to\nmatch the CAT task. As shown in Figure 4, we validated the impact\nof different components on DCSR in the NCD-MAAT CAT system,\nwith C set as the target domain and other domains as the source\ndomains. Specifically, when CSUM is removed from DSCR, perfor-\nmance drops significantly, indicating that the specific cognition\nof the source domain, as a confounding variable, hinders the true\ncausal effect, leading to negative transfer. Similarly, when HCM\nis removed, there is also a certain degree of performance decline,\nsuggesting that excessive uncertainty affects the alignment of the\ngenerated results with the CAT task. Therefore, all components\ncontribute to DCSR to varying degrees.\n5.4\nPerformance under long test steps (RQ3)\nTo explore the impact of DCSR on cold-start performance under a\ngreedy algorithm, as shown in Figure 5, we extended the test length\nin the IRT-Fisher CAT system and used single-domain information\nas the prior information provider, with the commonly used Random\nmethod as the baseline. We observed that in the early stages of\ntesting, regardless of the source domain, cold-start performance\nimproves significantly. Notably, when C++ is used as the source\ndomain, the initial effect already surpasses the Random method\nafter 60 rounds of question selection due to the correlation between\ncourses. This demonstrates that DCSR not only alleviates the issue\nof selection algorithms falling into local optima but also guides\nthe selection algorithm by providing an accurate starting point for\ntesting. Additionally, even when a weakly correlated course is used\nas the source domain, the optimal result of the traditional Random\nmethod can be achieved within a shorter test length.\n5.5\nCold-Start in Cognitive Diagnosis (RQ4)\nTo explore the performance of DCSR in addressing the cold-start\nproblem in cognitive diagnosis task, we directly applied DCSR to\nCDM, including unidimensional IRT and multidimensional NCD.\nAs shown in Figure 6, DCSR demonstrates superior performance\nin CDM across different dimensions, approaching Oracle perfor-\nmance in some scenarios. Moreover, in high-dimensional CDM, i.e.,\nNCD, DCSR further enhances cold-start performance in CD task.\nIt significantly outperforms the commonly used Random method.\nAdditionally, in scenarios where the correlation is not obvious,\n\nDiffusion-Inspired Cold Start with Sufficient Prior in Computerized Adaptive Testing\nKDD ’25, August 03–07, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada\nFigure 6: Performance on cognitive diagnosis cold start task.\nFigure 7: T-SNE visualization of abilities in the target domain.\nsuch as using DS as the source domain and C++ as the target do-\nmain, DCSR shows better performance than MLCCM, significantly\noutperforming baselines.\n5.6\nAnalysis of Initialized Ability (RQ5)\nWe further explored whether the abilities assigned by DCSR to\nexaminees in the target domain are reasonable. We conducted the\nanalysis from two aspects. First, using high-dimensional NCD as the\nbackbone, we visualize the distribution of initial abilities assigned\nto examinees by different methods across 12 scenarios. As shown\nin Figure 7, the ability distribution assigned by the Random method\nis clearly spherical, which is not conducive to distinguishing be-\ntween examinees’ abilities. In contrast to the localized clustering\npresented by MLCCM, DCSR is closer to that exhibited by Oracle,\nshowing clear differentiation. This demonstrates that introducing\nexaminees’ cross-domain common cognition can generate more\npersonalized initial abilities. Secondly, we randomly selected an\nexaminee, obtained his diagnostic feedback using NCD, and ran-\ndomly selected ten knowledge concepts to calculate the difference\nbetween the diagnosis results of the corresponding dimensions and\nthe results of Oracle. As shown in Figure 8, DCSR shows signif-\nicantly lower fluctuation and tends to underestimate the ability\nof examinee rather than overestimate him as MLCCM does. This\nFigure 8: Case analysis of an individual examinee.\napproach better serves the CAT system, as underestimating abil-\nity can guide the selection algorithm to choose relatively simpler\nquestion, avoiding the negative emotions associated with overly\ndifficult question.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we propose the Diffusion Cognitive States Transfer\nFramework to address the Cold Start with Insufficient Prior (CSIP)\nin Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT). This challenge compels\nCAT systems to use additional selection steps to mitigate the cold\nstart issue. To address this, we first reconstruct the examinee’s\ninitial ability in the target domain, guided by diffusion principle.\nConcurrently, we analyze the causal relationships in the gener-\nated outcomes from a model-based causal perspective, proposing\nthree decoupling strategies to block the two backdoor paths that\nhinder causal discovery. Subsequently, we introduce constraints\nfrom the perspectives of consistency and task-oriented to enforce\nalignment of the generated outcomes with the CAT system. There-\nfore, this framework can be applied to existing mainstream CAT\nsystems. Finally, extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness\nand applicability of our framework.\nReferences\n[1] Haoyang Bi, Haiping Ma, Zhenya Huang, Yu Yin, Qi Liu, Enhong Chen, Yu Su,\nand Shijin Wang. 2020.
