Introduction\nIn recent years, significant advancements have been made in the field\nof time series analysis, driven by the growing availability of complex high-\ndimensional data from various sources such as sensor networks [1], finan-\ncial markets [2], and biomedical applications [3]. Accurately capturing and\nanalyzing these time series data is crucial for applications such as activity\nrecognition [4], anomaly detection [5], and predictive modeling [6].\nAmong them, MTS classification is a significant research topic with ap-\nplications in various fields, such as human activity recognition [4], leading to\nnumerous studies in recent years [7, 8]. The focus of attention has been on\nthe similarities and long-range dependencies inherent in MTS data [9].\nHowever, modeling MTS data presents challenges due to temporal changes\nthat complicate the capture of long-range dependencies, as well as high di-\nmensionalcharacteristicsthathindertheidentificationofsimilaritiesbetween\nsamples.\nTo address the above two challenges, various methods have been pro-\nposed. For similarities extraction challenge between time series, DTW\nand its variants focus on measuring the dynamic similarities between time\nseries through nonlinear alignment. While effective in capturing tempo-\nral alignment, these methods often exhibit limitations when handling high-\ndimensional data, particularly in terms of expensive time complexity, which\nis O(mn2)(Here, m is the dimension of the MTS and n is the length). This\nmeans that when processing long sequences and high-dimensional data, the\ncomputational overhead of DTW can become prohibitively large, leading to\ninefficiency. Consequently, numerous methods, such as indexing (Time Series\nIndexing) [10], sparsification [11], lower bounding [12], and constraint path\n[13] have been proposed to reduce complexity and improve computational ef-\nficiency. Another difficulty is how to align the temporal dynamics to obtain\nmore accurate similarity. When using DTW to calculate high-dimensional\n2\nMTS, the dimensions are usually added together to calculate the average,\nthus losing various key features of each dimension.\nForlong-rangedependenciesextractionchallenge,deeplearningmeth-\nods have recently made significant progress recently. Long Short-Term Mem-\nory networks (LSTM) [14] effectively capture long-term dependencies in time\nseries. However, LSTM models may face challenges such as high computa-\ntionalcomplexityandoverfittingwhendealingwithlongtimeseries. Another\nimportant development is the Transformer model [15, 16, 17, 18], whose self-\nattentionmechanismmakesitpossibletocaptureglobaldependencies. While\nTransformer suffer from quadratic complexity, leading to low computational\nefficiency and high costs. Recently, Selective State Space Models (SSM) like\nMamba [19, 20] becomes popular, which can handle long-range dependen-\ncies in sequences while maintaining near-linear complexity, have garnered\nwidespread attention. Numerous works have emerged in the fields of time\nseries [20] [21], images [22], graph data [23], and natural language [24]. SSM\neffectively capture the dynamic properties of time series using state transi-\ntion equations to describe system evolution over time. Their ability to utilize\nhidden states allows SSMs to simultaneously capture long-range dependen-\ncies across multiple time points, making them ideal for modeling delays and\nmemory effects in time-dependent data.\nAfter getting similarities and long-range dependencies, to com-\nbine both is another key challenge. In recent years, Graph Neural Net-\nworks (GNN) [25, 26] have found extensive application in the field of time\nseries analysis, particularly in handling complex dependencies within graph-\nstructureddatainvolvingmultipletimeseriesdimensions. Intimeseriesdata,\nGNN can combine temporal and structural features to achieve more accu-\nrate modeling and prediction. Examples include GIN [27], GCN [28], GAT\n[29], Spatial-Temporal GNN [30], and GraphSAGE [31]. However, many of\nthese methods model either static [32] or dynamic dependencies [33] between\ndimensions. While current time series GNN are often used to obtain feature\nrepresentations of time series.\nTherefore,tocombinesimilaritiesandlong-rangedependencies,eachsam-\nple in the data set can be regarded as a node in the graph. The edge relation-\nship between nodes can be modeled using similarities, and the node features\ncan be modeled using long-range dependencies. Recently, several researches\n[34, 35] combine similarities based edge relationship and node features to\ncomplete node classification.\nIn response to the above three challenges, we propose CS-DPMamba for\n3\nMTS node classification. Firstly, to obtain the similarity of each sample in\nthe dataset, we initially used TemCL to acquire time series representations\nand then constructed a similarity matrix using FastDTW. Then, we apply\nDPMamba model, which considers the bidirectional nature of time series,\nallowing us to better capture both long-range and short-range dependencies\nin the time series. Finally, we utilize the KAN-GIN network for MTS node\nclassification. By comprehensively considering the long-range dependencies\nand dynamic similarity features, we achieve more accurate MTS node clas-\nsification.\nThe main contributions of this study include:\n1. We propose contrast similarity-aware dual-pathway Mamba for MTS\nnodeclassificationandconductexperimentsontheUEAdataset,demon-\nstrating the superiority.\n2. We use temporal contrastive learning to acquire time series representa-\ntions and then constructed a similarity matrix between representations\nusing FastDTW, capturing the dynamic similarities of the time series.\n3. We use dual-pathway Mamba to extract high-level features from bidi-\nrectionaltimeserieswhileeffectivelymanagingcomplexdata,capturing\nboth long-range and short-range dependencies.\n2. Related work\n2.1. Mamba-Based Methods\nMamba was proposed [19] to address weaknesses in discrete modes by\nsetting SSM parameters as input functions, allowing the model to selectively\npropagate or forget information based on the current token. Mamba in-\ntegrates these selective SSMs to construct a simplified end-to-end neural\nnetwork architecture that does not use attention or Multi-Layer Perceptron\n(MLP)block. Thearchitectureexhibitslinearscalabilityandcanhandlereal-\nworld data sequences up to millions in length. Recently, many Mamba-based\nmethods have been proposed. TSCMamba [21] introduces a novel multi-\nview approach that fuses frequency-domain and time-domain features using\nspectral features from continuous wavelet transforms. It utilizes State Space\nModels (SSMs) for efficient and scalable sequence modeling, incorporating a\nunique tango scanning scheme to enhance sequence relationship modeling.\nC-Mamba [36] employs a newly developed SSM to capture cross-channel\n4\ndependencies while maintaining linear complexity and preserving a global\nreceptive field. It integrates channel mixing to enhance the training set by\ncombining two channels, alongside a channel attention-enhanced Mamba en-\ncoderthatleveragesSSMtomodelcross-timedependenciesandinter-channel\ncorrelations. FMamba [37] first extracts temporal features of input variables\nthrough an embedding layer, then calculates dependencies between input\nvariables with a fast attention module. Finally, Mamba selectively processes\nthe input features, and a MLP block further extracts temporal dependencies\nof the variables.\n2.2. Graph-Based Methods\nGNN [38] can effectively capture complex relationships between different\ndimensions in time series by representing these dimensions and their inter-\nactions through graph structures.\nRecently, many GNN-based methods have been proposed. Many mod-\nels overlook seasonal effects and the evolving characteristics of shapelets.\nTime2Graph++ [39] addresses this by introducing a time-level attention\nmechanism to extract time-aware shapelets. Subsequently, time series data\nis transformed into shapelet evolution graphs to capture evolving patterns,\nfurther enhanced by graph attention to improve shapelet evolution. Exist-\ning methods (e.g., Transformer) struggle to effectively utilize spatial correla-\ntions between variables. To address this, Graphformer [40] efficiently learns\ncomplex temporal patterns and dependencies across multiple variables. It\nautomatically infers an implicit sparse graph structure through a graph self-\nattention mechanism. Current methods mainly focus on temporal consis-\ntency, neglecting the importance of spatial consistency. TS-GAC [41] aims\nto enhance the spatial consistency of MTS data. Specifically, it introduces\ngraph augmentation techniques for nodes and edges to maintain the stabil-\nity of sensors and their associations. Subsequently, robust sensor and global\nfeatures are extracted through node- and graph-level contrast. Graph net-\nworks can only capture spatiotemporal dependencies between node pairs and\ncannot handle higher-order correlations in time series. DHSL [42] uses the\nk-nearest neighbor method to generate a dynamic hypergraph structure from\ntime series data and optimizes the structure through a hyper graph struc-\nture learning to capture higher-order correlations. Finally, the dynamically\nlearned hypergraph structure is applied to a spatiotemporal hyper GNN.\nRecently, several research [34] treats time series as nodes in a graph, with\nnode similarity calculated using DTW and incorporated into the GNN. Due\n5\nto the high complexity of DTW, further research [35] uses the lower bound\nof DTW to calculate similarity, reducing the time complexity. However, the\nlower bound provides only an estimate, not an exact distance. This means\nthat in some cases, the final similarity measure may not be accurate enough,\nespecially in applications requiring high precision.\n3. Methods\n3.1.

ContrastFastDTW based Similarity Matrix Constructing\nFirst, to correctly align temporal dynamics and obtain more accurate\nsimilarity, we use TemCL module to obtain MTS representations (as shown\nin Fig. 2). And then, to obtain similarity more efficiently, we construct a\nsimilarity matrix between MTS representations using FastDTW, capturing\nthe dynamic similarities of time series.\nThe similarity matrix is computed according to the following steps, de-\ntailed as shown in Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3.\n• Obtain MTS Representations (step 1 in Algorithm 2): Use temporal\ncontrastive learning to obtain representations of the time series data.\nThis step captures the essential features of the time series.\n8\n• Clustering (step 2 in Algorithm 2): Apply KNN clustering algorithm\nto get clusters based on the number of classes.\n• Compute similarities within clusters (Algorithm 3 and step 3 in Al-\ngorithm 2): Calculate the distance between the representations of the\nMTS using FastDTWx. If they are not in the same cluster, they are\nconsidered dissimilar and a value of -1 is assigned.\n3.2.1. TemCL\nWedesigntemporalcontrastlearningmodule(TemCL)byleveragingself-\nsupervisedlearningtechniques, enhancesthemodel’srobustnesstovariations\nand noise in the time series, improves generalization performance by learn-\ning meaningful representations that can be used across different tasks. The\nTemCL model architecture is shown in Fig. 2. We extract temporal features\nby stacking multiple layers of convolution, ReLU, and max pooling modules,\nand construct negative samples by adding noise and cutting time series.\nTemCL module has the following advantages. First, the convolutional\nlayer can effectively extract key features in the time series through the local\nreceptivefieldmechanism. Thisfeatureextractionmethodcancaptureshort-\nterm and long-term pattern changes. Second, the pooling layer reduces the\ndimension of the data by downsampling, thereby reducing the computational\ncomplexity. Finally, the convolutional pooling structure is robust to noise\nand interference. Therefore, TemCL makes the similarity measurement more\naccurate by optimizing the feature representation.\nAug1\nzi Sim(zi , zj) Co Ln ot sr sast\nAug3\n······ zj\n·····\nDataset\nEncoder\nFigure 2: Contrast learning model.\n9\nD1vnoC ULeR\nd1looPxaM\nEncoder\nD1vnoC ULeR\nd1looPxaM\nnettalF\nAlgorithm 2 ContrastFastDTW Matrix\nRequire: Dataset list: D, target dimension: d , number of epochs: E,\ntarget\nbatch size: B, the number of class: class\n1: for each dataset D ∈ D do\n2: if pre-trained model exists then\n3: Load pre-trained model M ▷ Load existing pre-trained model\n4: else\n5: M ← ContrastLearning(D)\n6: Train M with data D using contrastive loss L ▷ Step 1: Train\nmodel using contrastive loss\n7: end if\nˆ\n8: Transform data D → D by passing it through model M ▷ Get\nrepresentations through the model\n9: C ← KNN Cluster(Dˆ , class) ▷ Step 2: Use KNN clustering to\nk\nget clusters if using early stopping\n10: DTWmatrix ←\nFastDTWx(Dˆ\n,C ) ▷ Step 3: Compute the DTW\nk\nmatrix by Algorithm 3\n11: end for\n12: function ContrastiveLearning(D,E,B)\n13: Initialize model M\n14: for epoch e ∈ {1,...,E} do\n15: for batch b ∈ {1,...,B} do\n16: Get positive samples D from batch b\np\n17: Generate negative samples X ←\nn\ngenerate negative samples(D ) ▷ Generate negative samples from\np\npositive samples\n18: Define labels y with y ← 1 for positive pairs, y ← 0 for\ni i\nnegative pairs ▷ Label positive and negative pairs\n19: Forward pass: Z ← M(D ), Z ← M(D ) ▷ Compute\np p n n\nrepresentations for positive and negative samples\n20: Compute loss L ← (1−y)·||Z −Z ||2 +y ·max(m−||Z −\np n p\nZ ||,0)2 ▷ Calculate contrastive loss\nn\n21: end for\n22: end for\n23: Return M ▷ Return the trained model\n24: end function\n10\nAlgorithm 3 FastDTWx\n1: function\nFastDTWx(representations=Dˆ\n, clusters=C , radius=1,\nk\ndist=Euclidean)\n2: similarity matrix ← zeros(N, N) ▷ Initialize similarity matrix\n3: for each cluster C in classes do\nk\n4: for each sample i ∈ C do\nk\n5: for each sample j ∈ C do ▷ Only compute within the cluster\nk\n6: distance ← FastDTW(dataset[i], dataset[j], radius, dist)\n▷ Compute similarity between samples\n7: similarity matrix[i][j] ← distance\n8: end for\n9: end for\n10: end for\n11: for each sample i not in any cluster do\n12: for each sample j in all other clusters do\n13: similarity matrix[i][j] ← −1 ▷ Assign dissimilarity if not in\nthe same cluster\n14: end for\n15: end for\n16: return similarity matrix ▷ Return similarity matrix\n17: end function\n18: function FastDTW(x, y, radius, dist)\n19: if length of x or y ¡ (radius + 2) then\n20: return DTW(x, y, dist)\n21: end if\n22: x shrinked, y shrinked ← ReduceByHalf(x), ReduceByHalf(y)\n23: distance, path ← FastDTW(x shrinked, y shrinked, radius, dist)\n24: return distance\n25: end function\n11\nThe contrastive loss can be defined as Eq. 1.\nN\n1 (cid:88)(cid:0) (cid:1)\nL = y ·d(f (p(Conv(x ))),p(Conv(x )))2\ni ReLU i j\nN\ni=1\nN\n1 (cid:88)(cid:0) (cid:1)\n+ (1−y )·max(0,m−d(f (p(Conv(x ))),p(Conv(x ))))2\ni ReLU i j\nN\ni=1\n(1)\nIn Eq. 1, N: Total number of training pairs. y : Binary label indicating\ni\nsimilarity (y = 1) or dissimilarity (y = 0) of pair (x ,x ). d(f(x ),f(x )):\ni i i j i j\nDistance metric between feature representations of x and x . m: Margin\ni j\ndefining the minimum distance between dissimilar pairs.

Pairwise Distance Matrix for MTS\nDTW is an algorithm used to measure the similarity between two time\nseries signals. It allows for nonlinear time alignment, enabling the optimal\nmatching of sequences even when they differ in speed or have temporal dis-\ncrepancies. The DTW calculation follows the following steps:\na) DTW Formulation\nGiven two time series X = (x ,x ,...,x ) and Y = (y ,y ,...,y ),\n1 2 n 1 2 m\nwherex andy areelementsoftheseries,DTWaimstofindanonlinear\ni j\nalignment that minimizes the alignment cost.\n12\nb) Distance Matrix Calculation\nFirst, compute the distance matrix D as Eq. (4), where each element\nD(i,j) represents the distance between the i-th element of X and the\nj-th element of Y. In Eq. (4), dist(x ,y ) is typically the Euclidean\ni j\ndistance or another distance metric.\nD(i,j) = dist(x ,y ) (4)\ni j\nc) Recursive Computation\nThe distance DTW(X,Y) is then recursively calculated using dynamic\nprogramming as Eq.

Define the cumulative distance matrix C,\nwhere C(i,j) represents the minimum cumulative distance from the\nstart point (1,1) to (i,j).\n\nC(i−1,j), (vertical move)\n\n\nC(i,j) = dist(x ,y )+min C(i,j −1), (horizontal move) (5)\ni j\n\nC(i−1,j −1) (diagonal move)\nThe initial condition is Eq.

FastDTW based Matrix\nLet X = {x ,x ,...,x } be a dataset of N MTS, where each x ∈ RT×N\n1 2 N i\nrepresents a time series with T time steps and N features. The FastDTW\ndistance between x and x is denoted as FastDTW(x ,x ).

Final Similarity Matrix\nAfter getting the FastDTW matrix D, to further describe the similarity,\nwe perform the following processing. First, we introduce a scaling hyperpa-\nrameter α ∈ [0,∞) to control the importance of top neighbors. Specifically,\nlet D denote the (i,j) entry of D. The adjacency matrix A is obtained by\nij\nthe following formula as Eq. 9.\n1\nA = , ∀i,j (9)\nij eαDij\nwhere A represents the (i,j) entry of A. A larger α will give more\nij\nimportance to the top neighbors.\nNext, tofilteroutirrelevantneighbors, wesamplethetopK neighborsfor\neach node. Specifically, for each row a in A, we keep only the K entries with\ni\nthe largest weights and set the others to zero, resulting in a sparse matrix.\nWhen handling similarity, we define a similarity function as Eq. 10.\n\n1 if A = 0\n ij\n\nsimilarity = 1 if A > 0 (10)\nij 1+|Aij| ij\n0 if A < 0\nij\nWhen A = 0, the similarity is 1, indicating maximum similarity.

When A < 0, the similarity is directly set to 0,\nij\nindicating complete dissimilarity.\nFinally, we normalize the adjacency matrix using the following formula\nas Eq. 11.\nA\n˜ ij\nA = , ∀i,j (11)\nij (cid:80)\nA\nj′ ij′\nIn the context of a GNN for node classification, Each MTS x is repre-\ni\nsented as a node in a graph. The matrix D defines the edge weights between\nnodes, where a smaller DTW distance indicates a stronger similarity and\nthus a stronger edge connection between nodes i and j. The GNN can use\nthis matrix as input to perform node classification based on the structural\nproperties of the graph formed by these time series.\n3.3.

KAN-GIN Layer\nWe utilize the KAN to enhance the expressive power of the GIN for node\nclassification. Although MLP are flexible in handling feature data, they\nfall short in capturing the complex dynamic characteristics of time series. In\ncontrast, the KAN enhances expressive power, allowing for better integration\nof temporal dependencies and graph structure features in time series, thereby\nimproving the accuracy of node classification.\nAfter obtaining the time series similarity matrix and the node features\nfrom the Mamba model, we proceed with node classification using the KAN-\nGIN model. The KAN-GIN layer is defined as Eq. (16).\n \n(cid:88)\nh(ℓ)(v) = KAN(ℓ) (1+ϵ)·h(ℓ−1)(v)+ h(ℓ−1)(u) (16)\nu∈N(v)\nwhere h(ℓ)(v) represents the hidden state of node v at layer ℓ, h(ℓ−1)(v) is\nthe hidden state of node v at the previous layer ℓ−1, N(v) denotes the set of\nneighbors of node v, ϵ is a learnable parameter that controls the contribution\nof the node’s own features, KAN(ℓ) is the kernel adaptive network function\napplied at layer ℓ.\n17\nTable 1: 10 datasets’s description.\nAbbre Datasets Train Test Dimension Length Classes\nAF AtrialFibrillation 15 15 2 640 3\nFM FingerMovements 316 100 28 50 2\nHMD HandMovementDirection 160 74 10 400 4\nHB Heartbeat 204 205 61 405 2\nLIB Libras 180 180 2 45 15\nMI MotorImagery 278 100 64 3000 2\nNATO NATOPS 180 180 24 51 6\nPD PenDigits 7494 3498 2 8 10\nSRS2 SelfRegulationSCP2 200 180 7 1152 2\nSWJ StandWalkJump 12 15 4 2500 3\n4.

Ablation Study\n4.3.1. Representations Ablation Experiment\nWe employed two methods to validate the effectiveness of the time series\nrepresentations through knn: ContrastFastDTW, which combines time series\nrepresentations obtained from TemCL module with FastDTW, and standard\ntime series with FastDTW. As show in Table. 4 and Fig. 5, ContrastFast-\nDTW achieves higher accuracy than using the original data on all datasets.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that TemCL can effectively generate\nhigh-quality time series representations, thereby enhancing classification per-\nformance.

Conclusion\nFor the difficulty to model similarities and long-range dependencies of\nMTS. We propose contrast similarity-aware DPMamba for MTS node clas-\nsification. First, to obtain the similarity in the dataset, we initially used\nTemCL to acquire time series representations and then constructed a simi-\nlarity matrix between MTS samples using FastDTW, capturing the dynamic\nsimilarity characteristics of the time series. Second, we applied the DP-\nMamba to consider the bidirectional nature of MTS, allowing us to better\ncapture long-range and short-range dependencies within the data. Finally,\nwe utilized the KAN to enhance the expressive power of the GIN for MTS\nnode classification. By comprehensively considering the long-range depen-\ndencies and dynamic similarity features of time series, we achieved precise\nnode classification. In the future, we will explore more efficient modeling\nmethods for calculating the similarity between samples.\n6.
