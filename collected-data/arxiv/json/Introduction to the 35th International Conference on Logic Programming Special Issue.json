Yang\nneering, Natural language processing, Web and Semantic Web, Agents, Artiﬁcial in-\ntelligence, Computational life sciences, Education, Cybersecurity, and Robotics.\nBesides the main track, ICLP 2019 included the following additional tracks and special\nsessions:\n• Applications Track: This track invited submissions of papers on emerging and\ndeployed applications of logic programming, describing all aspects of the develop-\nment, deployment, and evaluation of logic programming systems to solve real-world\nproblems, including interesting case studies and benchmarks, and discussing lessons\nlearned.\n• Sister Conferences and Journal Presentation Track: This track provided\na forum to discuss important results related to logic programming that appeared\nrecently (from January 2017 onwards) in selective journals and conferences, but\nhave not been previously presented at ICLP.\n• Research Challenges in Logic Programming Track: This track invited sub-\nmissions of papers describing research challenges that an individual researcher or\na research group is currently attacking. The goal of the track is to promote discus-\nsions, exchange of ideas, and possibly stimulate new collaborations.\n• Special Session. Women in Logic Programming: This special session included\nan invited talk and presentations describing research by women in logic program-\nming.\nThe organizers of ICLP 2019 were:\nGeneral Chairs\nEnrico Pontelli, New Mexico State University\nTran Cao Son, New Mexico State University\nProgram Chairs\nEsra Erdem, Sabanci University\nGerm´an Vidal, Universitat Polit`ecnica de Val`encia\nPublicity Chair\nFerdinando Fioretto, Georgia Institute of Technology\nWorkshops Chair\nMartin Gebser, University of Klagenfurt and Graz University of Technology\nTutorials Chair\nPedro Cabalar, University of Corunna\nDC Chairs\nPaul Fodor, Stony Brook New York\nDaniela Inclezan, Miami University\nProgramming Competition Chairs\nJos´e Morales, IMDEA Software Institute\nOrkunt Sabuncu, TED University\nApplications Track Chairs\nAndrea Formisano, Universita’ di Perugia\n\nTheory and Practice of Logic Programming\n3\nFangkai Yang, NVIDIA Corporation\nSister Conferences and Journal Presentation Track Chairs\nBart Bogaerts, Vrije Universiteit Brussel\nGiovambattista Ianni, Universit`a della Calabria\nResearch Challenges in Logic Programming Track Chairs\nAlessandro dal Pal`u, Universit`a di Parma\nAmelia Harrison, University of Texas at Austin and Google Inc.\nJoohyung Lee, Arizona State University\nWomen in Logic Programming Special Session Chairs\nAlicia Villanueva, Universitat Polit`ecnica de Val`encia\nMarina De Vos, University of Bath\nThree kinds of submissions were accepted:\n• Technical papers for technically sound, innovative ideas that can advance the state\nof logic programming.\n• Application papers that impact interesting application domains.\n• System and tool papers which emphasize novelty, practicality, usability, and avail-\nability of the systems and tools described.\nICLP implemented the hybrid publication model used in all recent editions of the con-\nference, with journal papers and Technical Communications (TCs), following a decision\nmade in 2010 by the Association for Logic Programming. Papers of the highest quality\nwere selected to be published as rapid publications in this special issue of TPLP. The\nTCs comprise papers which the Program Committee (PC) judged of good quality but not\nyet of the standard required to be accepted and published in TPLP as well as extended\nabstracts from the diﬀerent tracks and dissertation project descriptions stemming from\nthe Doctoral Program (DP) held with ICLP.\nWe have received 122 submissions of abstracts, of which 92 resulted in full submissions,\ndistributed as follows: ICLP main track (59), Applications track (9 full papers and 9 short\npapers), Sister Conferences and Journal Presentation track (11), and Women in Logic\nProgramming session (4). The Program Chairs organized the refereeing process, which\nwas undertaken by the PC with the support of external reviewers. Each technical paper\nwas reviewed by at least three referees who provided detailed written evaluations. This\nenabled a list of papers to be short-listed as candidates for rapid communication. The\nauthors of these papers revised their submissions in light of the reviewers suggestions, and\nall these papers were subject to a second round of reviewing. Of these candidates papers,\n30 were accepted as rapid communications, to appear in the special issue. In addition,\nthe PC recommended 45 papers to be accepted as technical communications, either as\nfull papers or extended abstracts, of which 44 were also presented at the conference (1\nwas withdrawn).\nThe 30 rapid communications that appear in this special issue are listed below:\n• Tiantian Gao, Paul Fodor and Michael Kifer.
