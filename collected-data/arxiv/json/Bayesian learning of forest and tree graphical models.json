An alternative is Bayesian structure-learning, in which \nit is common to restrict attention to certain classes of graphs and to explore and \napproximate the posterior distribution by repeatedly moving from one graph to another, \nusing MCMC or other methods such as stochastic shotgun search (SSS). I give two \ncorrected versions of an algorithm for non-decomposable graphs and discuss random \ngraph distributions in depth, in particular as priors in Bayesian structure-learning.  \nThe main topic of the thesis is Bayesian structure-learning with forests or trees. Forest \nand tree graphical models are widely used, and I explain how restricting attention to \nthese graphs can be justified using theorems on random graphs. I describe how to use \nmethods based on the Chow–Liu algorithm and the Matrix Tree Theorem to find the \nMAP forest and certain quantities in the full posterior distribution on trees.  \nI give adapted versions of MCMC and SSS for approximating the posterior distribution \nfor forests and trees, and systems for storing these graphs so that it is easy and efficient \nto choose legal moves to neighbouring forests or trees and update the stored \ninformation. Experiments with the adapted algorithms and simulated datasets show \nthat the system for storing trees so that moves are chosen uniformly at random does \nnot bring much advantage over simpler systems. SSS with trees does well when the true \ngraph is a tree or a sparse graph. Graph priors improve detection of hubs but need large \nranges of probabilities to have much effect. SSS with trees and SSS with forests do \nbetter than SSS with decomposable graphs in certain cases. MCMC on forests often fails \nto mix well and MCMC on trees is much slower than SSS. \n \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nI would like to thank my supervisor, Vanessa Didelez, for all her advice and guidance.

Much of this data \nis amenable to analysis by statistical methods. One example is the use of probabilistic \ngraphical models to analyze gene regulation networks. The key task is to deduce the \nstructure of the graphical model from the numerical expression values of a set of genes, \nobserved in a set of cells. These values are measured using microarrays.  \nThis task involves two types of “sparsity”. Firstly, the number of observations is usually \nmuch less than the number of variables (which is the number of nodes). This is the \nissue of “𝑛< 𝑝”, a major topic in statistics. Secondly, the graph is believed to have few \nedges.  \nAlbieri (2010) considered three frequentist algorithms for learning the structure of \nGaussian graphical models (GGMs) from numerical data with 𝑛< 𝑝. She used these \nalgorithms on expression values for a set of E. coli genes for which the true graph \nstructure had been deduced by biological experiments, and on several simulated \ndatasets that were generated using known graph structures. She found that when the \ntrue graph contained hubs (nodes that are connected to many other nodes), the \nalgorithms tended to produce graphs in which the hub and all the nodes connected to it \nformed a complete subgraph, making it impossible to tell which node was the hub. Hubs \nare one of the most notable features of gene regulation networks and other real-world \nnetworks, so these results suggest that the frequentist algorithms may be unsatis-\nfactory for learning the structures of these networks.  \n1.2 \nThe subjects of this thesis \nThe main subject of this thesis is Bayesian structure-learning for GGMs in the cases \nwhere attention is restricted to forests or trees. Forests are graphs that contain no \ncycles, and trees are connected forests (see Figure 1.1). Forests and trees are sparse \nand they exclude the possibility of the large complete subgraphs produced by the \nalgorithms in Albieri (2010).  \nOne of the main questions addressed by the thesis is whether it is sensible to restrict \nattention to forests or trees when there are existing methods that work on wider \nclasses of graphs. I have done numerous experiments to answer this question. Another \nis, how should different algorithms for Bayesian structure-learning be evaluated and \n\n1 Introduction \n \n 2 \ncompared? The thesis is also about prior distributions on the graph structure. One way \nto improve the discovery of hubs is to use a prior that gives higher probability to graphs \nthat contain hubs.  \nRestricting to forests or trees and using prior distributions can both be regarded as \nways to overcome the difficulties identified by Albieri (2010). But they also have \nbroader applicability and raise new questions. The thesis is mainly about Gaussian \ngraphical models, though some of the results and algorithms are valid for other types of \ngraphical models.  \n \n \nFigure 1.1. Left to right: a forest, a tree, and a graph that is neither.  \n \n1.3 \nStructure of the thesis \nChapter 2 gives an introduction to graphs and graphical models. Chapter 3 describes \nthe standard Bayesian method for structure-learning of GGMs, in which the number of \nnodes is fixed and every possible graph has a prior and posterior probability. Next is a \nreview of frequentist methods, including the main ones used by Albieri (2010).  \nChapter 4 explains corrections to an algorithm that is used on non-decomposable \ngraphs in Bayesian structure-learning. The purpose of the algorithm is to remove some \nof a set of extra edges to leave a minimal graph that is still triangulated. I present two \ncorrected versions of the algorithm and detailed discussions of how the original \nalgorithm goes wrong and which of the corrected versions is better.  \nThe prior and posterior distributions on the graph structure are random distributions \non the space of graphs with a fixed number of nodes. These random distributions are \ndiscussed in depth in chapter 5. Firstly I present two ways of looking at these \ndistributions, “random graph models” and “graph distributions”. I describe the main \ndistributions that have been studied outside the field of graphical models. I then give \nseveral definitions of what I call “factored” distributions. These can be used in several of \nthe algorithms for structure-learning that appear in subsequent chapters. (However, \nthey cannot be used as priors that encourage hubs, so I do not use them in my own \nexperiments.) Next I review distributions that have been used as priors in Bayesian \nstructure-learning and discuss the possibility of using graph priors based on random \ngraph models. Finally I present desirable criteria for graph priors and some possible \npriors that fulfil these criteria.  \n\n \n1.3 Structure of the thesis \n \n3 \nChapter 6 is about forest and tree graphical models. I give several reasons why it can be \nsensible to restrict attention to these relatively small classes of graphs and a detailed \nand formal consideration of one of these, the notion that sparse graphs are locally tree-\nlike.  \nChapters 7 and 8 are about fast algorithms for forest and tree graphical model \nstructure-learning. Chapter 7 is about the Chow–Liu algorithm, which finds the \nmaximum-likelihood tree graphical model. Adaptations of this algorithm can be used to \nfind a forest, using penalized likelihood, or to find the most likely graph in Bayesian \nstructure-learning restricted to trees or forests.  \nChapter 8 is about Bayesian structure-learning on trees using methods based on the \n19th-century Matrix Tree Theorem. A previously published paper explained how this \ntheorem can be used to find certain quantities exactly in polynomial time. I show how \nthe method works for GGMs and how it can be used to find certain useful quantities \nsuch as the posterior expected degrees of the nodes or the expected true-positive rate.  \nThe algorithms in chapters 7 and 8 are fast and produce objects that may be useful in \nBayesian structure-learning. But to estimate other quantities and objects, or to produce \nan estimate of the entire posterior distribution, it is necessary to visit large numbers of \nindividual graphs. With 15 or more nodes, the number of possible graphs is so large \nthat it is computationally infeasible to calculate the posterior probabilities of all of them. \nThis is true even when only forests or trees are considered. Instead, there are \nalgorithms that approximate the posterior distribution by exploring the space of \npossible graphs.  \nIn chapter 9, I propose new systems for storing forests and trees so that “local moves” \nto other forests or trees can be made easily and efficiently. For both types of graph, local \nmoves can be chosen uniformly at random from among all possible moves. Section 10.1 \ndescribes how to adapt two previously published algorithms for Bayesian structure-\nlearning of GGMs so that they can be used on forests and trees. These algorithms are the \nreversible-jump MCMC of Giudici & Green (1999) and the stochastic shotgun search \n(SSS) of Jones et al (2005). Section 10.2 is about how to evaluate and compare \nfrequentist and Bayesian methods for structure-learning. The graph or graphs \nproduced by the algorithm can be compared to the true graph, if that is known.  \nChapter 11 mostly consists of computer experiments to evaluate and compare the \nalgorithms and systems in chapters 8–10 and answer the question of whether it is \nsensible to restrict attention to forests or trees. Section 11.1 gives three new facts about \ntwo types of graph, stars and chains, to show that these graphs are extremal in senses \nto do with the numbers of local moves (equivalently, the numbers of neighbouring \ngraphs). For these reasons stars and chains are used in most of the experiments in the \nrest of the chapter.  \nSection 11.2 is about experiments to compare the system for storing trees described in \nsection 9.4 with three alternative systems, using one of my versions of the SSS algo-\nrithm. Section 11.3 has experiments on datasets for which the true graph is not a forest \nbut is sparse and locally tree-like, to see whether restricting attention to trees produces \ngood results in this case.  \n\n1 Introduction \n \n 4 \nSection 11.4 describes experiments with my versions of the reversible-jump MCMC. \nSection 11.5 compares SSS restricted to trees with the methods from chapter 8, which \ncalculate exact posterior quantities.  \nSection 11.6 has experiments with graph prior distributions that are designed to \nencourage hubs. These priors are compared with the uniform distribution, which has \nbeen the most commonly used graph prior in previous research. Finally, section 11.7 \ncompares SSS on trees, SSS on forests, and SSS on decomposable graphs, again to \naddress the question of whether it is sensible to restrict attention to trees or forests.  \nChapter 12 presents discussions and possibilities for future research. Appendix I gives \nthe results of some new graph enumerations, including the number of decomposable \ngraphs with 13 nodes, Appendix II is a glossary of terms from graph theory, and \nAppendix III defines asymptotic notations.  \n1.4 \nSummary of main contributions  \nThe main contributions of this thesis are as follows.  \n• \n(Chapter 4) Corrections to an algorithm for recursive thinning, including \nexplanation of how the algorithm goes wrong and two correct algorithms, with proofs.  \n• \n(Section 6.2) Rigorous investigation of the notion that sparse graphs are locally \ntree-like.  \n• \n(Section 8.2) Explanations of how a previously published algorithm can be used for \nBayesian structure-learning of tree GGMs and for finding the expected posterior \nvalues of certain quantities.  \n• \n(Chapter 9) Systems and algorithms for storing forests and trees so that local moves \ncan be made easily and uniformly at random, and numerous propositions related to these.  \n• \n(Section 10.1) Modifications of two previously published algorithms for Bayesian \nstructure-learning of GGMs so that they can be used on forests and trees.  \n• \n(Chapter 11) Experiments to assess the systems for storing forests and trees, assess \nhow structure-learning with trees performs when the true graph has cycles, \ncompare different graph prior distributions, and compare structure-learning with \ntrees and forests to structure-learning with decomposable graphs.  \n1.5 \nThe meanings of n and p \nIn the Erdős–Rényi random graph model 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑝), 𝑛 is the number of nodes and 𝑝 is the \nprobability of each edge being present. But in multivariate statistics, 𝑛 is usually the \nnumber of data and 𝑝 is the dimension of the problem, which in graphical models is the \nnumber of nodes. Both these systems of notation are very standard in their respective fields.  \nBoth Erdős–Rényi graphs and multivariate statistics arise many times in this thesis, but \nseldom close to each other. So I use standard notation throughout, except briefly in \nsection 11.3. The meanings of 𝑛 and 𝑝 are consistent within individual chapters, but not \nwithin the whole thesis. The meanings are stated when the two letters first appear in \neach chapter and should also be obvious from the context. (Note that 𝑝(⋅) is also used to \nmean probability density functions, and in chapter 6 the number of data is 𝑚.) \n\n \n5 \n2 \nGraphs and graphical models \n2.1 \nGraphs \nBasic definitions \nThese definitions are sufficient for this thesis and are not the most general. See also \nAppendix II, which is a glossary of relevant terms.  \n• \nA graph 𝐺 is a pair (𝑉, 𝐸), where 𝑉 is a finite set of nodes, also known as vertices, \nand 𝐸 is a set of edges.  \n• \nIn an undirected graph, the elements of 𝐸 are unordered pairs (𝑢, 𝑣), where 𝑢, 𝑣∈𝑉. \n(Standard practice is to write unordered pairs using braces, as {𝑢, 𝑣}, but I use \nregular parentheses, like Edwards et al 2010.)  \n• \nIn a directed graph, the elements of 𝐸 are ordered pairs (𝑢, 𝑣), where 𝑢, 𝑣∈𝑉.  \nAll graphs considered in this thesis are simple, which means they do not have multiple \nedges or self-loops. In other words, all the elements of 𝐸 are distinct, in directed graphs \nif (𝑢, 𝑣) ∈𝐸 then (𝑣, 𝑢) ∉𝐸, and in both types of graph if (𝑢, 𝑣) ∈𝐸 then 𝑢≠𝑣.  \nOf course graphs are usually thought of visually. The nodes are dots, and the edges are \nlines between pairs of dots. A directed edge (𝑢, 𝑣) is drawn as an arrow from 𝑢 to 𝑣.  \n• \nA subgraph of 𝐺 is a graph 𝐻= (𝑉′, 𝐸′) where 𝑉′ ⊆𝑉, 𝐸′ ⊆𝐸, and 𝑢, 𝑣∈𝑉′ for all \n(𝑢, 𝑣) ∈𝐸′. The notation 𝐻⊆𝐺 means that 𝐻 is a subgraph of 𝐺.  \n• \nAn induced subgraph is a subgraph (𝑉′, 𝐸′) in which 𝑉′ ⊆𝑉 and 𝐸′ = {(𝑢, 𝑣) ∈\n𝐸: 𝑢, 𝑣∈𝑉′}.  \n• \n𝑉𝐺 means the set of nodes in 𝐺 and 𝐸𝐺 means the set of edges in 𝐺. If (𝑉′, 𝐸𝑉′) is an \ninduced subgraph then 𝐸𝑉′ means the set of edges in the subgraph induced by 𝑉′.  \n• \nThe set of neighbours of 𝑣 is 𝑛𝑒(𝑣) = {𝑢∈𝑉: (𝑢, 𝑣) ∈𝐸 or (𝑣, 𝑢) ∈𝐸}.  \n• \nThe degree of 𝑣 is deg 𝑣= |𝑛𝑒(𝑣)|.  \n• \nThe size of 𝐺 is |𝐸|.  \nPaths \n• \nIn an undirected graph, a path is a sequence of distinct nodes (𝑢1, 𝑢2, … , 𝑢𝑘) such \nthat (𝑢1, 𝑢2), (𝑢2, 𝑢3), … , (𝑢𝑘−1, 𝑢𝑘) ∈𝐸.  \n• \nIn a directed graph, a directed path is a sequence of distinct nodes (𝑢1, 𝑢2, … , 𝑢𝑘) \nsuch that (𝑢1, 𝑢2), (𝑢2, 𝑢3), … , (𝑢𝑘−1, 𝑢𝑘) ∈𝐸. It is natural to refer to this as a \ndirected path from 𝑢1 to 𝑢𝑘. (This is sometimes used as the definition of a “path” in \na directed graph—for example, see Lauritzen 1996, page 6.)  \n\n2 Graphs and graphical models \n \n 6 \n• \nIn a directed graph, a path is a sequence of distinct nodes (𝑢1, 𝑢2, … , 𝑢𝑘) such that \neither (𝑢1, 𝑢2) ∈𝐸 or (𝑢2, 𝑢1) ∈𝐸, either (𝑢2, 𝑢3) ∈𝐸 or (𝑢3, 𝑢2) ∈𝐸, …, and either \n(𝑢𝑘−1, 𝑢𝑘) ∈𝐸 or (𝑢𝑘, 𝑢𝑘−1) ∈𝐸. I may refer to (𝑢1, 𝑢2, … , 𝑢𝑘) as a path from 𝑢1 to \n𝑢𝑘, but “from” and “to” do not imply that the path is directed.  \n• \nIn an undirected graph, a cycle is a path (𝑢1, 𝑢2, … , 𝑢𝑘) where 𝑘≥3 and (𝑢𝑘, 𝑢1) ∈𝐸. \n• \nThe girth of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle, or infinity if it has no cycles.  \n• \nFor a graph to be connected means that there is a path between any two nodes.  \n• \nSuppose 𝐴, 𝐵, and 𝐶 are induced subgraphs of 𝐺 with no nodes in common. 𝐶 \nseparates 𝐴 and 𝐵 if any path between a node in 𝐴 and a node in 𝐵 includes a node \nin 𝐶.  \nDefinitions that only apply to directed graphs \n• \nIn an edge (𝑢, 𝑣), 𝑢 is called the parent and 𝑣 is called the child.  \n• \nThe set of children of 𝑣 is 𝑐ℎ(𝑣) = {𝑢∈𝑉: (𝑣, 𝑢) ∈𝐸}. \n• \nThe set of parents of 𝑣 is 𝑝𝑎(𝑣) = {𝑢∈𝑉: (𝑢, 𝑣) ∈𝐸}.  \n• \nThe set of descendants of 𝑣 is 𝑑𝑒(𝑣) = {𝑢∈𝑉: there is a directed path from 𝑣 to 𝑢}.  \n• \nThe set of ancestors of 𝑣 is 𝑎𝑛(𝑣) = {𝑢∈𝑉: there is a directed path from 𝑢 to 𝑣}.  \nClasses of undirected graph \n• \nA complete graph is an undirected graph where (𝑢, 𝑣) ∈𝐸 for all 𝑢, 𝑣∈𝑉. The \ncomplete graph on 𝑝 nodes is called 𝐾𝑝.  \n• \nA maximal complete subgraph 𝐻 of 𝐺 is called a clique. (Maximal means there is no \ncomplete subgraph 𝐻′ of 𝐺 such that 𝐻⊆𝐻′ and 𝐻≠𝐻′.)  \n• \nA forest is an undirected graph that has no cycles. In a forest, any two nodes are \nconnected by at most one path.  \n• \nA tree is a connected forest. In a tree, any two nodes are connected by exactly one \npath.  \n• \nFor a connected graph 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸), a spanning tree of 𝐺 is a tree 𝑇= (𝑉, 𝐸′) such \nthat 𝐸′ ⊆𝐸.  \nDecomposable graphs \nDecomposable graphs are a class of undirected graphs that is especially important in \ngraphical models. A proper decomposition of 𝐺 is a pair of induced subgraphs \n((𝐴, 𝐸𝐴), (𝐵, 𝐸𝐵))  such that 𝑉= 𝐴∪𝐵, 𝐴≠∅, 𝐵≠∅, 𝐴≠𝑉, 𝐵≠𝑉, the induced \nsubgraph with node-set 𝐶= 𝐴∩𝐵 is complete, and 𝐶 separates 𝐴∖𝐶 from 𝐵∖𝐶. This \n𝐶 is called a separator. It may be possible to decompose 𝐴 and 𝐵 further. Following \nrepeated decomposition, the subgraphs that cannot be decomposed any further are \ncalled the prime components of 𝐺. If all the prime components are cliques, then the \noriginal graph is said to be decomposable.  \nIf a graph is decomposable, then its cliques can be put in a perfect sequence (see the \ndefinition on pages 14–15 of Lauritzen 1996). As well as the list of cliques, a perfect \nsequence also gives a list of separators, which are sets of nodes that each induce a \ncomplete subgraph.  \n\n \n2.2 Graphical models \n \n7 \nThe lists of cliques and separators are used in expressions for the factorized joint \ndensity in graphical models (see section 2.2). The cliques are all distinct, but separators \ncan appear more than once in the list. For this reason the separators will be regarded as \na collection in which an element can appear more than once, rather than a set.  \nThe class of decomposable graphs is the same as the class of chordal graphs, which have \nbeen studied in graph theory. A chordal graph is one in which any cycle of length four or \nmore has a chord—for any cycle (𝑢1, 𝑢2, … , 𝑢𝑘) where 𝑘≥4 there is an edge (𝑢𝑖, 𝑢𝑗) \nwhere 𝑖, 𝑗∈{1, … , 𝑘} and 𝑢𝑖 and 𝑢𝑗 are not adjacent in the cycle. For a proof that these \ntwo classes of graphs are equivalent, see Proposition 2.5 in Lauritzen (1996), which \nuses “weakly decomposable” instead of “decomposable” and “triangulated” instead of \n“chordal”. In chapter 4 I will use the term “triangulated”. Section 2.5 gives other names \nfor this class of graphs.  \nTrees and forests \nChapter 9 will use many times the fact that in a tree there is precisely one path between \nany two nodes. Proposition 2.1 is another simple fact about trees that will be referred to \nin section 7.2.  \nProposition 2.1. Adding one edge to a tree creates a graph that has precisely one cycle.  \nProof. Suppose the tree is 𝑇 and the extra edge is 𝑒= (𝑢, 𝑣). Being a tree, 𝑇 contains no \ncycles. So any cycle in 𝑇+ 𝑒, meaning (𝑉𝑇, 𝐸𝑇∪{𝑒}), must consist of 𝑒 and a path from 𝑢 \nto 𝑣 in 𝑇. Conversely, any path from 𝑢 to 𝑣 in 𝑇 will give rise to a cycle when 𝑒 is added. \nSince 𝑇 is a tree, there is precisely one path from 𝑢 to 𝑣 in 𝑇, so 𝑇+ 𝑒 contains precisely \none cycle.   \nFor another proof, see Theorem 2.1(b) in Even (1979).  \nAll trees and forests are decomposable. The cliques are the pairs of nodes that have \nedges between them. In trees, the separators are the nodes that have degree 2 or more. \nIn forests, the separators are the nodes that have degree 2 or more and the empty set. \nSo the cliques all have size 2 and the separators all have size 1 or 0.  \nDefinitions and facts to do with rooted trees are given in “Facts about rooted trees”, in \nsection 9.2.  \n2.2 \nGraphical models \nConditional independence and graphical models \n𝑋 and 𝑌 are conditionally independent given 𝑍 if 𝑝( 𝑥, 𝑦∣∣𝑧) = 𝑝( 𝑥∣𝑧)𝑝( 𝑦∣∣𝑧) for all \n𝑥 and 𝑦 and for all 𝑧 such that 𝑝(𝑧) > 0. In symbols this is written as 𝑋 \n 𝑌 | 𝑍.  \nA graphical model consists of a graph in conjunction with a multivariate statistical \nmodel or family of models. Each node 𝑣 of the graph represents a single variable, 𝑋𝑣. In \nthis thesis, it will be assumed that the joint density of these univariate random variables \nis positive and continuous with respect to a product measure. For more general cases, \nsee chapter 3 of Lauritzen (1996).  \n\n2 Graphs and graphical models \n \n 8 \nThe structure of the graph summarizes relations of conditional independence between \nthe variables. In undirected graphical models, if 𝑢, 𝑣∈𝑉 then (𝑢, 𝑣) ∉𝐸⇒𝑋𝑢 \n 𝑋𝑣 | 𝑋𝑉∖{𝑢,𝑣}. This is called the pairwise Markov property, and with the assumption \nabove it is equivalent to the local and global Markov properties (Lauritzen 1996, section \n3.2.1). In directed acyclic graphical models, also known as Bayesian networks, 𝑋𝑣 \n 𝑋𝑉∖𝑑𝑒(𝑣) | 𝑋𝑝𝑎(𝑣) for all 𝑣∈𝑉.  \nGraphical models are used for specifying, analyzing, and interpreting complex relations \nbetween random variables. Much of this thesis is about graphical models where the \ngraph is a forest or a tree. For these graphs, there are simple equivalences between \ndirected and undirected graphical models. To explain these requires three definitions. \nSee section 9.2 for the definitions of “rooted tree” and “rooted forest”; and for two \ngraphical models to be “Markov-equivalent” means that they imply the same \nconditional independence relations. The equivalence between the directed and \nundirected graphical models is that rooted trees or forests are Markov-equivalent to the \nundirected trees or forests formed by removing the direction from each edge.  \nGaussian graphical models \nThis thesis is mainly about Gaussian graphical models (GGMs), which are undirected. \nThese are one of the most widely studied types of graphical model. In a GGM, the \nvariables follow a multivariate normal distribution, 𝑋~𝑁𝑝(𝜇, Σ). One property of this \ndistribution is that 𝑋𝑖 \n 𝑋𝑗 | 𝑋𝑉∖{𝑖,𝑗} ⇔(Σ−1)𝑖𝑗= 0. (Here the nodes are identified with \nthe numbers {1, … , 𝑝}.) This can be seen by writing out the joint density and factorizing \nit, and has been known at least since Wermuth (1976). Using the definition of \nundirected graphical models, it follows that (𝑖, 𝑗) ∉𝐸⇒(Σ−1)𝑖𝑗= 0. In other words, the \nedges that are absent from the graph correspond to zeroes in the precision matrix 𝐾=\nΣ−1 (also known as the concentration matrix).  \nThe object of interest is Σ rather than 𝜇, so it is common to set 𝜇= 0. Data can easily be \ncentred so that 𝑥̅ = 0. Suppose 𝑋 is an 𝑛× 𝑝 matrix that contains 𝑛 observations of a 𝑝-\nvariate Gaussian distribution, and let 1𝑛 be an 𝑛× 𝑛 matrix of 1s. The centred matrix is \n(𝐼𝑛−1𝑛/𝑛)𝑋.  \nGGMs can be used to model gene regulation networks, as discussed in section 2.4, and \nfinancial objects such as currency values (Carvalho et al 2007) and asset returns \n(Carvalho & Scott 2009). Murray & Ghahramani (2004) state that GGMs are “trivial”. \nThis can perhaps be taken to mean that they are simpler than general undirected \ngraphical models.  \nStructure-learning \nOne of the main tasks or problems to do with graphical models is structure-learning. \nThis is the problem of how to infer the graph structure from observations of the \nrandom variables. Another is the problem of inference—how to calculate distributions \non certain nodes given observations of other nodes.  \nMaximum-likelihood methods can be used for many statistical problems. But in \ngraphical model structure-learning, the maximum-likelihood graph is always the \ncomplete graph, because this implies no restrictions on the variables. The maximum-\n\n \n2.3 The covariance and precision matrices for GGMs \n \n9 \nlikelihood estimator of the covariance matrix always exists if 𝑛> 𝑝, but only sometimes \nexists if 𝑛≤𝑝 (for details see Lauritzen 1996, section 5.2.1). In microarray experiments \n(see section 2.4), 𝑛≪𝑝, so maximum-likelihood methods cannot be used.  \nFor GGMs there are a variety of frequentist and Bayesian methods for structure-\nlearning. These are described in chapter 3. The main topic of this thesis is Bayesian \nstructure-learning of forests and trees.  \n2.3 \nThe covariance and precision matrices for GGMs \nPossible partial correlations \nFirstly, to standardize a matrix 𝑀 means to replace it by 𝐷𝑀𝐷, where 𝐷 is the diagonal \nmatrix whose elements are 𝑑𝑖𝑖= 𝑚𝑖𝑖\n−1/2. The (𝑖, 𝑗) element of the standardized matrix is \nthus 𝑚𝑖𝑗/√𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑗𝑗, so the diagonal elements of the standardized matrix are all 1.  \nIn Gaussian graphical models, not all combinations of partial correlations are possible. \nLet the precision matrix Σ−1 be 𝐾, and consider the standardized precision matrix 𝐶, \nwhere 𝑐𝑖𝑗= 𝑘𝑖𝑗/√𝑘𝑖𝑖𝑘𝑗𝑗 and −1 ≤𝑐𝑖𝑗≤1. The partial correlation between 𝑋𝑖 and 𝑋𝑗 is \n𝑟𝑖𝑗= −𝑐𝑖𝑗 (for 𝑖≠𝑗), so 𝐶 could be called the negative partial correlation matrix. The \nprecision matrix has to be positive-definite, so 𝐶 also has to be positive-definite.  \nSylvester’s criterion (Gilbert 1991) states that a matrix is positive-definite if and only if \nthe determinants of all its square upper-left submatrices are positive. These \ndeterminants are called the leading principal minors of the matrix. Applying this \ncriterion to 𝐶 gives a set of algebraic inequalities that must be satisfied by the partial \ncorrelations.  \nFor some graphs, these inequalities can be greatly simplified. Consider a graph in which \nnode 1 has edges to all the other nodes, and there are no other edges apart from these. \nThe graph is called a “star” and node 1 is called a “hub”. In this case, \n𝐶=\n(\n \n \n1\n𝑐12\n𝑐13\n⋯\n𝑐1𝑝\n 𝑐12\n1\n0\n⋯\n0 \n 𝑐13\n0\n1\n⋯\n0 \n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋱\n⋮ \n 𝑐1p\n0\n0\n⋯\n1 )\n \n  . \nOne of the square upper-left submatrices is the entire matrix. The determinant of this \nbeing positive is equivalent to  \n∑𝑐1𝑗\n2\n𝑝\n𝑗=2\n< 1 . \nIf this inequality holds then the other leading principal minors are also positive. So this \ninequality on its own is a necessary and sufficient condition for 𝐶 being positive-\ndefinite and the distribution being valid. The necessary and sufficient condition on the \npartial correlations is obviously just ∑\n𝑟1𝑗\n2\n𝑝\n𝑗=2\n< 1 . \n\n2 Graphs and graphical models \n \n 10 \nIt follows, for example, that in a V-shaped graph with three nodes and two edges, at \nleast one of the partial correlations along the edges must have magnitude less than \n√1/2 ≈0.707. More generally, in a star with 𝑠 “rays”, there must be at least one partial \ncorrelation on an edge that has magnitude less than √1/𝑠.  \nAs a necessary condition, the inequality generalizes to graphs that contain stars as \ninduced subgraphs. This is because the nodes can simply be reordered so that the hub \nis node 1 and the other 𝑠 nodes of the star come next. The above argument applied to \nthe upper-left (𝑠+ 1) × (𝑠+ 1) submatrix shows that ∑\n𝑟1𝑗\n2\n𝑠+1\n𝑗=2\n< 1 . For example, in any \ngraph that contains a V-shape, which means any graph that does not consist entirely of \ndisjoint cliques, there must be at least one partial correlation on an edge that has \nmagnitude less than 0.707.  \nAs far as I am aware, these conditions on partial correlations in stars have not \npreviously appeared in published research. The closest thing I have found is assump-\ntions A3 and A4 in Kalisch & Bühlmann (2007), which are about the numbers of neigh-\nbours of nodes and the magnitudes of the partial correlations in GGMs. These assump-\ntions are also used in Maathuis et al (2009).  \nFor shapes other than stars, it is easy to write down the inequalities that result from \nSylvester’s criterion, but it is generally not easy to rearrange them into a useful form.  \nPossible standard correlations \nMore widely known than partial correlations, and possibly also of interest, are the \nstandard correlations. These can be found by inverting the standardized precision \nmatrix and standardizing.  \nAs with partial correlations, the conditional independence relations shown by the graph \nimply conditions on the correlations. However, these conditions are not as simple or \nnotable as the ones for partial correlations. For the V-shaped graph on three nodes,  \n𝐶= (\n1\n𝑐12\n𝑐13\n 𝑐12\n1\n0 \n 𝑐13\n0\n1\n), \nwhich means that the upper triangle of the correlation matrix, found by inverting and \nthen standardizing, is  \n(\n  \n \n1\n−𝑐12\n√1 −𝑐13\n2\n−𝑐13\n√1 −𝑐12\n2\n1\n𝑐12𝑐13\n√(1 −𝑐12\n2 )(1 −𝑐13\n2 )\n \n1\n)\n  \n \n. \nIt can be seen that 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟(𝑋2, 𝑋3) = 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟(𝑋1, 𝑋2)𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟(𝑋1, 𝑋3). The correlation between \nthe two unconnected nodes is the product of the other two correlations.  \nFor arbitrary-sized stars, a standard formula for the inverse of a partitioned matrix can \nbe used to show that  \n\n \n2.3 The covariance and precision matrices for GGMs \n \n11 \n𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟(𝑋1, 𝑋𝑖) = −𝑐1𝑖[1 −𝑡 + 𝑐1𝑖\n2 ]\n−1/2  \nand  𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟(𝑋𝑗, 𝑋𝑘) = 𝑐1𝑗𝑐1𝑘[(1 −𝑡 + 𝑐1𝑗\n2 )(1 −𝑡 + 𝑐1𝑘\n2 )]\n−1/2   for 𝑗, 𝑘≠1, \nwhere 𝑡= ∑\n𝑐1𝑚\n2\n𝑝\n𝑚=2\n. Again 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟(𝑋𝑗, 𝑋𝑘) = 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟(𝑋1, 𝑋𝑗)𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟(𝑋1, 𝑋𝑘). There is no simple \ngeneralization to graphs that contain stars as induced subgraphs.  \nCreating possible covariance matrices \nChapter 11 is about experiments to evaluate and compare algorithms for Bayesian \nstructure-learning of GGMs. These experiments use simulated datasets that each \ncorrespond to a particular graph. This subsection is about the issues involved in \ncreating these simulated datasets and several ways of doing it.  \nGiven a covariance matrix 𝛴, data from 𝑁𝑝(0, 𝛴) can easily be generated in R or other \nstatistical packages. But creating a possible Σ for a given graph is sometimes non-trivial. \nNecessary and sufficient conditions on Σ are that it be symmetric and positive-definite, \nand that the precision matrix 𝐾= Σ−1 have zeroes in the positions that correspond to \nabsent edges in the graph. Of course the task of creating a possible covariance matrix is \nequivalent to creating a possible precision matrix or negative partial correlation matrix.  \nNumerous papers describe experiments that must have involved creating covariance \nmatrices for given graphs, but most do not mention how this was done. It seems likely \nthat the authors chose the partial correlations to all be equal and reasonably large, and \nthen made adjustments as necessary to ensure that the matrix was positive-definite. \nThe papers that do mention how it was done mostly describe specific simple matrices. \nMeinshausen & Bühlmann (2006, page 1448) generated large random graphs whose \nnodes have maximum degree 4, and chose all the partial correlations to be 0.245. They \nstate that absolute values less than 0.25 guarantee that the precision matrix is positive-\ndefinite. For general graphs, no such statement can be made, as shown in “Possible \npartial correlations”, above. Guo et al (2011, pages 6–7) created precision matrices for \n“chain” graphs, then added extra edges at random. For each extra edge they set the two \ncorresponding elements of the precision matrix to be a random value from \n𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑓([−1, −0.5] ∪[0.5,1]).  \nOne sure-fire way to create a possible Σ is to use the formulas in Appendix A of Roverato \n(2002). This method was used by Castelo & Roverato (2006). It uses the Cholesky \ndecomposition 𝐾= Φ𝑇Φ, where Φ  is an upper-triangular matrix. The diagonal \nelements of Φ, and the elements that correspond to edges in the graph, can be chosen \nfreely, and Roverato calls these the “free” elements. The other elements, which he calls \n“fixed”, have to be calculated according to Roverato (2002)’s equation (10). 𝐾 and 𝛴 can \nthen be calculated from Φ.  \nFor decomposable graphs, the calculations for fixed elements can be avoided, as in \nAlbieri (2010). If the vertices are ordered according to a perfect vertex elimination \nscheme, then all the fixed elements of Φ are zero (Roverato 2002, page 408). A perfect \nvertex elimination scheme is the reverse of a perfect numbering—see Lauritzen (1996, \npage 15).  \n\n2 Graphs and graphical models \n \n 12 \nThe next question is how to choose the free elements of Φ. For very small graphs it is \npossible to work out explicit formulas for how the elements of Φ will affect the \nelements of 𝐾, but for most graphs it is not. It is undesirable to have partial correlations \nthat are very close to zero, since these edges will be difficult to detect. But in most \ngraphs it is impossible for all the partial correlations to have large magnitude—see \n“Possible partial correlations” above. The simplest way is to set all the free elements to \nhave the same value, though one’s first choice might not give a positive-definite matrix \nbecause of hubs or other structures.  \nAn alternative way to create a covariance matrix for a given graph is to first choose any \nsymmetric matrix 𝐾 such that the diagonal elements are positive and the elements \ncorresponding to absent edges are zero. Find the eigenvalues of 𝐾, and if any of these \nare negative, let −𝜆 be the lowest one. Replace 𝐾 with 𝐾+ 𝛾𝐼, for some 𝛾> 𝜆. This \nensures that all the eigenvalues are positive, so 𝐾 is positive-definite, without \ndisturbing the off-diagonal zeroes or the symmetry. Schäfer & Strimmer (2005a, pages \n757–758) used a similar method, though they added quantities to each of the diagonal \nelements individually. (The R package “GeneNet”, by Schäfer et al 2012, contains a \nfunction that performs their method.)  \nHaving created a possible covariance matrix from which to generate simulated data, it is \ncommon to standardize the matrix so that the variances are all 1. This ensures that the \nvariables are all on the same scale.  \nThe datasets used in the experiments in chapter 11 mostly correspond to true graphs \nthat are trees. To create the covariances for these datasets, I started by setting 𝐾 to have \n1’s on the diagonal and equal values in all the positions that correspond to edges. I then \ninverted 𝐾 and standardized to create Σ.  \n2.4 \nBiomolecular networks \nModelling biomolecular networks \nThe ultimate intended application of my work on GGMs is gene regulation networks. \nEach gene corresponds to a node, and the numerical value for each node is the \nlogarithm of the expression level of that gene. The networks arise because genes are \ntranscribed to form molecules of mRNA, which are then translated to form proteins, and \nsome of these proteins are transcription factors that promote or inhibit the tran-\nscription of other genes (Pournara & Wernisch 2007).  \nThe idea of using GGMs to model gene regulation networks was first proposed in Fried-\nman et al (2000). This paper used Bayesian networks and the Bayesian structure-\nlearning methods described in Heckerman et al (1995). It contains several significant \nideas, for example that most of the difficulties arise from the number of variables being \nmuch greater than the number of observations—that is, 𝑛≪𝑝—and the idea of using \nprior biological knowledge about the network structure. GGMs have subsequently been \nused to model gene regulation networks in Castelo & Roverato (2006, 2009), Albieri \n(2010), Edwards et al (2010), and probably many others—as of February 2013, Google \nScholar says that Friedman et al (2000) has been cited 2285 times.  \n\n \n2.4 Biomolecular networks \n \n13 \nThere are numerous public databases that contain the results of experiments to \nmeasure gene expression levels, for example the National Center for Biotechnology \nInformation’s Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett et al 2007) and M3D (Faith et al \n2008). These databases usually have 𝑛≪𝑝.  \nFor details of the preliminary statistical analysis of microarray experiments, including \nexperimental design and how the data is processed and cleaned, see Wit & McClure \n(2004). Sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 of this book present arguments for and against the use \nof the multivariate Gaussian distribution to model log gene expression levels.  \nMeasurements of gene expression levels are produced using DNA microarrays. These \nare an example of a high-throughput method—a method that can quickly produce data \non large numbers of biomolecules. GGMs can also be used to model other large bio-\nmolecular networks. For an overview of this topic see Markowetz & Spang (2007).  \nIt is believed that gene regulation networks and other biomolecular networks tend to \nhave certain properties related to the degrees of the nodes and other features of the \ngraph. These properties are the topic of the next few subsections. Some of the research \nin this area has not been mathematically rigorous. For example, in Barabási & Albert \n(1999) the description of the growth of “scale-free” graphs (see below) is not a full \ndefinition of a random process, as pointed out in Bollobás et al (2001). In this section I \nwill just report the properties without attempting to state or discuss them in a fully \nmathematical way. Some of them are discussed further in chapter 5.  \nHubs \nBiomolecular networks tend to contain a few nodes, called hubs, that are connected to a \nlarge number of other nodes. In gene regulation networks, the biological meaning of a \nhub is that one gene codes for a protein that regulates the expression of many other \ngenes. Hubs are probably the most notable and widely recognized characteristic of bio-\nmolecular networks. For example, Barabási & Oltvai (2004) report that the transcrip-\ntional gene regulation networks of E. coli and S. cerevisiae (yeast) contain \ndisproportionately many hubs. In Alterovitz & Ramoni (2006), Figure 1 shows several \nhubs in the E. coli gene regulation network that have very large numbers of neighbours. \nRoyer et al (2008) states that hubs are also a feature of protein networks, and that the \nabundance of hubs can be explained by models of evolution.  \nOther motifs \nCertain small-scale motifs also seem to be common in biomolecular networks. Motifs \nare subgraphs, or induced subgraphs, that appear more often in real networks than in \n“randomized networks” (Milo et al 2002). Milo et al (2002) set out to find three- and \nfour-node motifs in various well-studied directed networks including the E. coli and S. \ncerevisiae gene regulation networks. They compared these real networks to random \ngraphs where each node had the same number of incoming and outgoing edges as in \nthe real networks, and found that the feed-forward loop and the bi-fan—see Figure \n2.1—occur far more frequently in the gene regulation networks. The 𝑍-values for these \nmotifs ranged from 10 to 41.  \n\n2 Graphs and graphical models \n \n 14 \nRoyer et al (2008) states that protein interaction networks tend to have cliques and \nbicliques. A biclique is two sets of nodes where every node in one set is connected to \nevery node in the other—see Figure 2.1. Alon (2007) shows a directed biclique from \nthe transcription regulation network of E. coli (in his Figure 6).  \n \n \nFigure 2.1. Left to right: a feed-forward loop, a bi-fan, and a biclique. These motifs have been \nfound to be common in real-world networks.  \nSparsity \nIt is widely believed that biomolecular networks are sparse, meaning that they have few \nedges. The precise meaning of this statement is discussed in depth in section 6.2. For \nexample, Leclerc (2008) reports the numbers of nodes and edges in gene networks for \nArabidopsis, Drosophila, and three other widely studied model organisms. All these \nnetworks are sparse. Pournara & Wernisch (2007) state that gene regulation networks \nare sparse because most genes are known to be regulated by a small number of tran-\nscription factors and most transcription factors regulate a small number of genes. \nProtein interaction networks are also believed to be sparse (Spirin & Mirny 2003). \nMany papers simply assert without elaboration that biomolecular networks are \nsparse—for example Wille & Bühlmann (2006) and Han et al (2007).  \nScale-free networks \nBarabási & Oltvai (2004) state that the most striking feature of biomolecular networks, \nas well as social and technological networks, is that they are approximately “scale-free”. \nThis term was introduced by Barabási & Albert (1999) and means that, over a large \nrange, the degrees of the nodes follow a power law; that is, the probability that a node \nhas degree 𝑘 is proportional to 𝑘−𝛾. In most cases, 2 < 𝛾< 3.  \nIn scale-free graphs most nodes have small degrees, but a few have very high degrees. \n(In other words, the power-law distribution is long-tailed.) So for biomolecular \nnetworks both the sparsity and the relative preponderance of hubs could be regarded \nas consequences of being scale-free.  \nJeong et al (2001) reports that the S. cerevisiae protein network follows a power law, \nand Jeong et al (2000) studied metabolic networks of 43 species and found strong \nevidence of power laws. However, Barabási & Oltvai (2004) state that in the \ntranscriptional gene regulation networks of E. coli and S. cerevisiae, the degree \ndistributions are mixtures of power laws and exponential distributions.  \n\n \n2.5 Supplementary notes: alternative terms and the history of graphical models \n \n15 \nLog-transformation \nGene expression data needs to be log-transformed before being modelled by the multi-\nvariate Gaussian distribution. But websites, online databases, and papers that present \nthis kind of data do not always state whether this has been done.  \nFor example, Albieri (2010) used a gene expression dataset with 100 nodes and 43 \nobservations that was a subset of the EcoliOxygen dataset in the R package “qpgraph” \n(Castelo & Roverato 2009). The EcoliOxygen dataset is reported in Covert et al (2004) \nand available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s Gene \nExpression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/, Barrett et al 2007), where it \nis record number GDS680. Without looking at the numerical values themselves, it is not \nobvious whether the values in EcoliOxygen have been log-transformed. Covert et al \n(2004) mentions a 𝑡-test on log-transformed data, but that is all.  \nI found a different database of E. coli gene expression data, M3D (http://m3d.bu.edu/, \nFaith et al 2008), where it is stated that the values are log-transformed. I plotted a \nhistogram of all the expression levels from M3D and a histogram of all the EcoliOxygen \ndata. The two distributions looked similar, which suggests that the EcoliOxygen data \nhave been log-transformed.  \n2.5 \nSupplementary notes: alternative terms and the history \nof graphical models \nBooks about graphical models include Pearl (1988), Whittaker (1990), Edwards (1995), \nLauritzen (1996), Cowell et al (2007), and Koller & Friedman (2009). Graphical models \nare also known as probabilistic graphical models or graphical Markov models \n(Wermuth 1998, Wermuth & Cox 2001). Undirected graphical models are sometimes \ncalled Markov random fields, and directed acyclic graphical models are often called \nBayesian networks (Bayes nets for short) or belief networks.  \nFor a brief history of graphical models see Wermuth (1998), in which their origins are \ntraced back to the early twentieth century. Gaussian graphical models originate in \nDempster (1972). But Dempster did not mention graphs or conditional independence. \nWhat he proposed was to simplify the multivariate normal distribution 𝑁𝑝(𝜇, 𝛴) by \nsetting some elements of 𝛴−1 to zero. Dempster called this “covariance selection”, and \nas a result Gaussian graphical models are also known as covariance selection models. \nThey are occasionally called concentration graph models (Wermuth & Cox 2001).  \nThe task of inferring the graph structure from data is often called “structural learning”, \nthough I prefer “structure-learning”. It is also referred to as “model selection”, “reverse \nengineering” (Alon 2003, Castelo & Roverato 2009, Maathuis et al 2010), “topology \ndiscovery” (Anandkumar et al 2011), and “estimation of structure” (Lauritzen 2012). \nFor GGMs it is sometimes called covariance selection. Structural learning contrasts with \n“quantitative learning”, which means estimating the numerical parameters of the \nprobability distribution (Giudici 1996).  \nIn the field of graphical models it is common to talk about “decomposable” graphs. In \ngraph theory these are called chordal graphs (Gavril 1974, Diestel 2005, Bondy & Murty \n\n2 Graphs and graphical models \n \n 16 \n2008). Sometimes they are called triangulated graphs (Rose 1970, Rose 1972, Berge \n1973, Lauritzen 1996, Diestel 2005). They have also been called rigid circuit graphs \n(Dirac 1961), perfect elimination graphs (Rose et al 1976), and monotone transitive \ngraphs (Rose 1972).  \nRegarding the terms “star” and “hub”, it is not ideal to use words that are unrelated in \nthe real world for mathematical objects that are closely related. But “hub” often refers \nto the centre of a network, so its use in describing graphs is natural; and it is useful to \nhave the separate word “star” for the hub and the nodes connected to it. Both are \ncommonly used—“hub” in Barabási & Oltvai (2004) and Albieri (2010), for example, \nand “star” in Royer et al (2008) and Yuan & Lin (2007).  \n \n\n \n17 \n3 \nStructure-learning for GGMs \n3.1 \nBayesian methods  \nThe standard Bayesian method \nBayesian learning of graphical model structure involves a likelihood, a prior distri-\nbution, some data, and a posterior distribution. The prior and the posterior are both \ndistributions on the set of all graphs with the appropriate number of nodes, or in the \ncase that only a certain subset of graphs is considered, they are distributions on that set \nof graphs. The prior is specified by the user or researcher and the posterior is \ncalculated from the prior and the data.  \nThe most widely used Bayesian method for learning Gaussian graphical model \nstructure requires a prior distribution on Σ as well as the prior on the graph structure. \nSuppose there are 𝑝 nodes. Let 𝑥 be the 𝑛× 𝑝 matrix (𝑛 rows, 𝑝 columns) of the 𝑛 \nobserved data:  \n𝑥=\n(\n \n𝑥1\n𝑇\n𝑥2\n𝑇\n⋮\n𝑥𝑛𝑇)\n , \nand let 𝑈= 𝑥𝑇𝑥. (𝑈 is usually called 𝑆, but I use 𝑆 to mean separators.) The likelihood is  \n𝑝( 𝑥∣∣𝐺𝑖, Σ ) = (2𝜋)−𝑛𝑝/2|𝐾|𝑛/2 exp [−1\n2 ∑𝑥𝑖\n𝑇𝐾𝑥𝑖\n𝑖\n] \n= (2𝜋)−𝑛𝑝/2|𝐾|𝑛/2 exp [−1\n2 tr(𝐾𝑈)] , \nwhere 𝐾= Σ−1, and the posterior probability of 𝐺𝑖 being the true graph is  \n𝑝( 𝐺𝑖∣∣𝑥) =\n𝑝( 𝑥∣∣𝐺𝑖)𝑝(𝐺𝑖)\n∑𝑝( 𝑥∣∣𝐺𝑗)𝑝(𝐺𝑗)\n𝑗\n. \nThe meaning of 𝑝(⋅) changes according to its arguments. Of the terms on the right-hand \nside, 𝑝(𝐺𝑖) is the prior probability of 𝐺𝑖 and 𝑝( 𝑥∣∣𝐺𝑖) is the marginal likelihood: \n𝑝( 𝑥∣∣𝐺𝑖) = ∫\n𝑝( 𝑥∣∣𝐺𝑖, Σ ) 𝑝( Σ ∣∣𝐺𝑖) 𝑑Σ\nΣ−1∈𝑀+(𝐺𝑖)\n .  \nHere 𝑀+(𝐺𝑖) is the set of positive-definite matrices that have zeroes in the positions \nthat correspond to absent edges in 𝐺𝑖. So the integral is over all values of Σ that are \npossible for 𝐺𝑖.  \n\n3 Structure-learning for GGMs \n \n 18 \nFor 𝑝( Σ ∣∣𝐺𝑖) it is common to use the generalized hyper inverse Wishart (HIW) distri-\nbution (Dawid & Lauritzen 1993), which is conjugate. This and other priors for Σ are \ndescribed in the next few subsections. Graph priors are discussed in chapter 5.  \nComplete graphs \nIf the graph is known to be the complete graph, 𝐾𝑝, then the distribution of 𝑥 is just the \nmultivariate Gaussian distribution with no conditional-independence restrictions, and \nthe conjugate prior for Σ is the inverse Wishart distribution. This is defined as follows.  \nIf 𝑋 is an 𝑚× 𝑝 matrix where each row is an independent sample from the 𝑝-variate \nGaussian distribution with zero mean and covariance matrix 𝑉, then the 𝑝× 𝑝 matrix \n𝑈= 𝑋𝑇𝑋 has the Wishart distribution with scale matrix 𝑉 and 𝑚 degrees of freedom. I \nwill write this as 𝑈 ~ 𝑊(𝑚; 𝑉). For 𝑈 to be invertible with probability 1, it is necessary \nthat 𝑚≥𝑝. The distribution of Σ = 𝑈−1 is then the inverse Wishart distribution with \ninverse scale matrix 𝐷= 𝑉−1 and 𝑚 degrees of freedom. I will write this as 𝐼𝑊(𝛿, 𝐷), \nwhere 𝛿= 𝑚−𝑝+ 1.  \nThe only restrictions on the parameters for the Wishart distribution are that 𝑉 be \npositive-definite and 𝑚 be positive. The only restrictions on the parameters for the \ninverse Wishart distribution are that 𝐷 be positive-definite and 𝑚≥𝑝, which means \n𝛿≥1. Obviously under these characterizations 𝑚 and 𝑝 are both positive integers.  \nIf Σ ~ 𝐼𝑊(𝛿, 𝐷), then the density of Σ is \n𝑝(Σ) =\n|𝐷|(𝛿+𝑝−1)/2 exp [−1\n2 tr(𝐷Σ−1)]\n2(𝛿+𝑝−1)𝑝/2 |Σ|𝑝+𝛿/2 Γ𝑝((𝛿+ 𝑝−1)/2) \n=\n|𝐷\n2|\n(𝛿+𝑝−1)/2\n exp [−1\n2 tr(𝐷Σ−1)]\n |Σ|𝑝+𝛿/2 Γ𝑝((𝛿+ 𝑝−1)/2)\n \n(Giudici & Green 1999, page 787; Roverato 2002, page 396). Here Γ𝑝 is the multivariate \ngamma function (James 1964), defined by \nΓ𝑝(𝑎) = 𝜋𝑝(𝑝−1)/4 ∏Γ[𝑎+ (1 −𝑗)/2] .\n𝑝\n𝑗=1\n \nThe “normalizing constant” for the inverse Wishart distribution is the part of the \nformula for the density that does not involve Σ (Jones et al 2005). There is no problem \nwith terms like |Σ|𝑝+𝛿/2, where the exponent can be non-integer, since Σ and 𝐷 are both \npositive-definite and so their determinants are positive.  \nDecomposable graphs \nFor a decomposable graph, the conjugate prior for Σ is the hyper inverse Wishart (HIW) \ndistribution. This was defined by Dawid & Lauritzen (1993) and also described in detail \nin Giudici & Green (1999).  \n\n \n3.1 Bayesian methods \n \n19 \nFor a given decomposable graph, suppose the cliques have covariances Σ𝐶 and the prior \non each Σ𝐶 is 𝐼𝑊(𝛿, 𝐷𝐶), where 𝛿 is some positive number that is the same for all \ncliques. Dawid & Lauritzen (1993) showed that these distributions on the cliques \ninduce a unique hyper Markov distribution on Σ, the covariance for the whole graph. In \nthis distribution, Σ is constrained so that its inverse has zeroes in the appropriate \nplaces, which means the distribution is Markov on the graph. They called this the hyper \ninverse Wishart distribution and showed that it is conjugate for the family of \nmultivariate Gaussian distributions that are Markov on the graph.  \nTwo issues that arise in specifying the 𝐷𝐶’s are hyperconsistency and compatibility. \nHyperconsistency means that the distributions of the clique covariances have to be the \nsame where they overlap, so (𝐷𝐶1)𝑖𝑗= (𝐷𝐶2)𝑘𝑙 whenever (𝑖, 𝑗) and (𝑘, 𝑙) identify the \nsame edge. Compatibility between the distributions on two graphs means that any \nclique that appears in two graphs has the same distribution in both cases. Hyper-\nconsistency is essential but compatibility is merely desirable. Probably the simplest \nway to ensure hyperconsistency and compatibility is to choose a single 𝑝× 𝑝 matrix 𝐷, \nand for each graph let each 𝐷𝐶 or 𝐷𝑆 be the appropriate submatrix of 𝐷. For full details \nof these issues see Dawid & Lauritzen (1993) or Giudici & Green (1999). For \nincomplete graphs not every element of 𝐷 is used.  \nI will parameterize the HIW distribution using a 𝑝× 𝑝 matrix 𝐷 and write it as \n𝐻𝐼𝑊𝐺(𝛿, 𝐷). If Σ ~ 𝐻𝐼𝑊𝐺(𝛿, 𝐷) then the density of Σ is \n𝑝(Σ) =\n∏𝑝( Σ𝐶∣∣𝐺)\n𝐶\n∏𝑝( Σ𝑆∣∣𝐺)\n𝑆\n, \nwhere Σ𝐶 ~ 𝐼𝑊(𝛿, 𝐷𝐶) and Σ𝑆 ~ 𝐼𝑊(𝛿, 𝐷𝑆). The product in the numerator is over the set \nof cliques, and the product in the denominator is over the collection of separators. A \nseparator may appear more than once in this collection.  \nFor the HIW prior to be proper, it is sufficient that 𝛿> 2 (Roverato 2002, page 402; \nJones et al 2005, page 390) and 𝐷−1 ∈𝑀+(𝐺) (Atay-Kayis & Massam 2005, page 322). \nIf the prior on Σ is 𝐻𝐼𝑊𝐺(𝛿, 𝐷), then the posterior is 𝐻𝐼𝑊𝐺(𝛿+ 𝑛, 𝐷+ 𝑈), where 𝑈=\n𝑥𝑇𝑥 is a sufficient statistic for the data 𝑥.  \nThe marginal likelihood 𝑝(𝑥∣𝐺) can be found explicitly as follows. In the following \nexpressions, |𝛴| is the determinant of 𝛴 but |𝐶| is the number of elements in 𝐶:  \n𝑝( 𝑥∣𝐺) = ∫𝑝( 𝑥∣𝐺, Σ )𝑝( Σ ∣𝐺) 𝑑Σ \n= ∫\n∏(2𝜋)−𝑛|𝐶|/2|Σ𝐶|−𝑛/2 exp [−1\n2 𝑡𝑟(𝑈𝐶Σ𝐶\n−1)]\n𝐶\n∏(2𝜋)−𝑛|𝑆|/2|Σ𝑆|−𝑛/2 exp [−1\n2 𝑡𝑟(𝑈𝑆Σ𝑆\n−1)]\n𝑆\n                                                        \n              ⋅ \n∏ \n|𝐷𝐶\n2 |\n𝛿+|𝐶|−1\n2\nΓ|𝐶| (𝛿+ |𝐶| −1\n2\n)\n  |Σ𝐶|−𝛿+2|𝐶|\n2\nexp [−1\n2 tr(𝐷𝐶 Σ𝐶\n−1)]\n𝐶\n∏ \n|𝐷𝑆\n2 |\n𝛿+|𝑆|−1\n2\nΓ|𝑆| (𝛿+ |𝑆| −1\n2\n)\n  |Σ𝑆|−𝛿+2|𝑆|\n2\nexp [−1\n2 tr(𝐷𝑆 Σ𝑆\n−1)]\n𝑆\n𝑑Σ \n\n3 Structure-learning for GGMs \n \n 20 \n=\n∏|𝐷𝐶\n2 |\n𝛿+|𝐶|−1\n2\n/ Γ|𝐶| (𝛿+ |𝐶| −1\n2\n) \n𝐶\n∏|𝐷𝑆\n2 |\n𝛿+|𝑆|−1\n2\n/ Γ|𝑆| (𝛿+ |𝑆| −1\n2\n) \n𝑆\n⋅(2𝜋)−𝑛𝑝/2 ∫\n∏ |Σ𝐶|−𝛿+𝑛+2|𝐶|\n2\nexp [−1\n2 tr({𝐷C + 𝑈𝐶} Σ𝐶\n−1)]\n𝐶\n∏ |Σ𝑆|−𝛿+𝑛+2|𝑆|\n2\nexp [−1\n2 tr({𝐷S + 𝑈𝑆} Σ𝑆\n−1)]\n𝑆\n𝑑Σ . \nIn these integrals the measure 𝑑Σ can be taken to be the product of the Lebesgue \nmeasures on the elements of the incomplete covariance matrix, which contains only the \nelements of Σ that correspond to edges in the graph (Giudici & Green 1999). The \nexponent of 2𝜋 is simplified using ∑|𝐶|\n𝐶\n−∑|𝑆|\n𝑆\n= 𝑝, which follows from the definition \nof a perfect sequence. In the second large expression, the first big fraction is the \nnormalizing constant for the HIW prior density (the part of this density that does not \ninvolve Σ) and the integrand is the HIW posterior density without its normalizing \nconstant. It follows that  \n𝑝( 𝑥∣𝐺) = (2𝜋)−𝑛𝑝/2\n∏\n𝑘(𝐶, 𝛿, 𝐷)\n𝑘(𝐶, 𝛿+ 𝑛, 𝐷+ 𝑈) \n𝐶\n∏\n𝑘(𝑆, 𝛿, 𝐷)\n𝑘(𝑆, 𝛿+ 𝑛, 𝐷+ 𝑈)\n𝑆\n \n , \nwhere 𝑘 is the normalizing constant for each clique or separator: \n𝑘(𝐶, 𝛿, 𝐷) =\n|𝐷𝐶\n2 |\n𝛿+|𝐶|−1\n2\n Γ|𝐶| (𝛿+ |𝐶| −1\n2\n)\n . \nOnce the marginal likelihood of a graph has been calculated, it is easy to find its \nunnormalized posterior probability, since 𝑝( 𝐺∣𝑥) ∝𝑝( 𝑥∣𝐺)𝑝(𝐺).  \nGeneral graphs \nFor graphs that may or may not be decomposable, the conjugate prior for Σ is the \ngeneralization of the HIW distribution given by Roverato (2002). This is called the G-\nWishart distribution in Atay-Kayis & Massam (2005), Lenkoski & Dobra (2011), and \nWang & Li (2012).  \nAs in the decomposable case, the density can be written as the product of densities on \nthe prime components divided by the product of densities on the separators (Roverato \n2002, Proposition 2). For the separators and complete prime components, the density \nis the inverse Wishart distribution, as before. For any incomplete prime components, \nthe density is  \n𝑝(Σ𝑃\n𝐸) ∝|Σ𝑃|−𝛿−2\n2  𝐽(Σ𝑃\n𝐸) exp [−1\n2 tr(𝛴𝑃\n−1𝐷𝑃)]. \nHere 𝐸 is the edge-set of the prime component 𝑃. The reason for writing the density as \na function of Σ𝑃\n𝐸, rather than just Σ𝑃, is to emphasize that its dimension equals the \nnumber of free (unconstrained) elements in Σ𝑃. (In contrast, with cliques and \n\n \n3.1 Bayesian methods \n \n21 \nseparators the dimension of the random variable is |𝐶|(|𝐶| + 1)/2, or the same with \n𝑆—the full number of elements in the Cholesky square root.) Some of the non-free \nelements of Σ𝑃 appear in the expression to the right of the proportional symbol. It \nwould also be possible to just write Σ𝑃 throughout. The term 𝐽(Σ𝑃\n𝐸) is the Jacobian for \nthe transformation from 𝐾𝑃\n𝐸 to Σ𝑃\n𝐸.  \nTo find the marginal likelihood, let 𝑘(𝑃, 𝛿, 𝐷) be the normalizing constant in the \nexpression for 𝑝(Σ𝑃\n𝐸), so that  \n𝑘(𝑃, 𝛿, 𝐷)−1 = ∫\n|Σ𝑃|−𝛿−2\n2  𝐽(Σ𝑃\n𝐸) exp [−1\n2 tr(𝛴𝑃\n−1𝐷𝑃)] 𝑑Σ𝑃\n𝐸\nΣ𝑃\n𝐸∣𝑃\n. \nThis integral cannot be calculated exactly and is discussed in the next subsection. As \nwith decomposable graphs, the marginal likelihood factorizes according to the decom-\nposition of the graph:  \n𝑝( 𝑥∣𝐺) = (2𝜋)−𝑛𝑝/2\n∏\n𝑘(𝑃, 𝛿, 𝐷)\n𝑘(𝑃, 𝛿+ 𝑛, 𝐷+ 𝑈) \n𝑃\n∏\n𝑘(𝐶, 𝛿, 𝐷)\n𝑘(𝐶, 𝛿+ 𝑛, 𝐷+ 𝑈) \n𝐶\n∏\n𝑘(𝑆, 𝛿, 𝐷)\n𝑘(𝑆, 𝛿+ 𝑛, 𝐷+ 𝑈)\n𝑆\n \n. \nThe three products are over the incomplete prime components, the cliques, and the \nseparators. The 𝑘’s in the first product in the numerator are defined by the equation \nwith the integral, and the 𝑘’s in the other two products are as in the previous subsection.  \nCalculating the normalizing constant for incomplete prime components \nThe problem with the above expression for the marginal likelihood is that 𝑘(𝑃, 𝛿, 𝐷), \nthe normalizing constant for incomplete prime components, cannot be calculated \nexactly. For calculating it approximately, Roverato (2002) presents a method that uses \nimportance sampling and Atay-Kayis & Massam (2005) give a method that uses simple \nMonte Carlo. Lenkoski & Dobra (2011) use a Laplace method that is quicker but less \naccurate. Moghaddam et al (2009) give two other Laplace-type methods.  \nMoghaddam et al (2009) describe Monte Carlo methods as the “gold standard” for this \nproblem. Section 4.2 of Atay-Kayis & Massam (2005) presents their Monte Carlo \nmethod as a step-by-step algorithm. First, change variables from Σ to 𝐾, and then to Φ, \nthe Cholesky square root of 𝐾. Then change variables to Φ post-multiplied by the \ninverse of the Cholesky square root of 𝐷−1. Next, manipulate this expression into the \nform of a multiple of the expectation of a function with respect to chi-squared and \nunivariate normal random variables (the former corresponding to the diagonal \nelements of the matrix, the latter corresponding to the edges that are present in the \ngraph). Finally, approximate the integral using simple Monte Carlo.  \nRoverato (2002) used the generalized HIW distribution to analyze Fisher’s iris data. \nThis is a well-known set of multivariate data with 𝑝= 4 that was published in Anderson \n(1935) and used in Fisher (1936). I have done the same analysis of this dataset, using \nthe same values of the HIW hyperparameters as Roverato (2002) and the same uniform \ngraph distribution, using Java. Instead of Roverato’s importance-sampling method, I \nused Atay-Kayis & Massam (2005)’s simple Monte Carlo method. The posterior \ndistribution that I found was very close to Roverato’s—see Figure 3.1. The reasons it \n\n3 Structure-learning for GGMs \n \n 22 \nwas not exactly the same were probably that both methods are random and that \nRoverato (2002) only used 15,000 samples for the importance sampling whereas I used \na billion for the Monte Carlo method. The top graph is a four-cycle, which is of course \nnon-decomposable.  \n \n \n0.14797 \n0.147 \n \n0.13481 \n0.135 \n \n0.10590 \n0.106 \n \n0.10583 \n0.106 \nFigure 3.1. The top four graphs for the iris data. Below each graph is its posterior probability \naccording to my program, with 1 billion iterations of the Monte Carlo method, and according to \nRoverato (2002).  \n \nExploring the posterior distribution  \nFor small 𝑝 it is possible to calculate the posterior probability for every possible graph. \nFor 𝑝 larger than about 10, this is computationally infeasible, because there are too \nmany graphs, even if attention is restricted to only decomposable ones. The solution is \nto somehow explore the space of graphs, moving from one graph to another repeatedly. \nMadigan & Raftery (1994) presented methods for doing this in an ad-hoc way, for both \ndirected and undirected graphical models.  \nGiudici & Green (1999) gave a reversible-jump MCMC algorithm for approximating the \nposterior distributions of Σ and the graph structure, in the case that attention is \nrestricted to decomposable graphs. The dimension-changing proposals consist of \nadding or deleting a single edge to the graph structure. The posterior graph distribution \nis taken to be the proportion of time spent at each graph. Asymptotically the Markov \nchain gives a sample from the exact true posterior distribution. Brooks et al (2003) give \nan adaptation of this method, and Green & Thomas (2013) give another MCMC algo-\nrithm for the same problem, which stores and manipulates not graphs but junction trees.  \nAs an alternative to MCMC, Jones et al (2005) proposed a “stochastic shotgun search” \nalgorithm for exploring either the space of all possible graphs or the space of all \ndecomposable graphs. At each step, this calculates the unnormalized posterior \nprobability of several neighbouring graphs, and then chooses which one to move to \naccording to a certain distribution based on those unnormalized probabilities.  \nSection 10.1 gives full descriptions of how the algorithms of Giudici & Green (1999) and \nJones et al (2005) can be adapted to the cases where attention is restricted to forests or \ntrees. Chapter 11 is about experiments to assess how well these adapted algorithms do.  \nMoghaddam et al (2009) propose a “neighbourhood fusion” method for exploring the \nposterior graph distribution for general GGMs. To do this, for each node use lasso \n\n \n3.1 Bayesian methods \n \n23 \nregression or a similar method to estimate its neighbourhoods of all possible sizes, and \ncalculate a probability for each neighbourhood. Then repeatedly sample from these \npossible neighbourhoods, combine them to create a graph, and calculate its score. \nDobra et al (2011) give an MCMC method for general graphs. For non-decomposable \ngraphs, the method avoids the need to find the posterior normalizing constant of the \nHIW distribution, which is the most time-consuming part of the calculations.  \nAn alternative conjugate prior \nOne possible weakness of the HIW prior is that it only has one scalar parameter (a \n“shape” parameter). Letac & Massam (2007) define an alternative prior, for decom-\nposable graphs, that has a scalar parameter for each possible clique and separator and \nis thus more flexible. This is a generalization of the HIW distribution and is still \nconjugate. Rajaratnam et al (2008) give a reference prior (in other words, a non-\ninformative prior—see Rajaratnam et al 2008, page 2819, or Gelman et al 2004, page \n61) that is an improper special case of Letac & Massam’s.  \nAn alternative method that just uses a prior for the covariance matrix \nThe rest of this thesis uses the HIW prior on Σ (though many sections are more general \nand not directly related to GGMs or Σ). But this is not the only Bayesian method for \nlearning GGM structure. Wong et al (2003) give a prior for Σ−1 that enables its off-\ndiagonal elements to be zero with positive probability. In effect this combines the priors \nfor Σ and the graphs into a single distribution. The prior is constructed as follows. \nFirstly they write Σ−1 as 𝑇𝐶𝑇, where 𝐶 is the negative partial correlation matrix and 𝑇 is \ndiagonal. 𝑇𝑖𝑖\n2 is given an uninformative gamma prior. For 𝐶𝑖𝑗 they use a hierarchical \nprior: each element is zero (corresponding to the edge being absent) with a certain \nprobability, and then 𝐶 is distributed uniformly in the space of possible values. They \ndescribe a reversible-jump MCMC scheme for generating values of Σ−1. The proposal \ndistributions are the full conditional distributions of 𝑇𝑖𝑖 and 𝐶𝑖𝑗, both approximated by \nnormal distributions. The distribution for 𝐶𝑖𝑗 is a mixture that uses the indicator \nfunction 𝕀[𝐶𝑖𝑗= 0].  \nThis method removes the need for a separate graph prior. It also applies to all graphs in \none go, whereas the HIW distribution described above is a separate distribution on Σ \nfor every graph. Experiments in Wong et al (2003) suggest that when Σ−1 is sparse the \nmethod works well compared to the maximum likelihood estimator of Σ and two \nestimators proposed by Yang & Berger (1994). The comparisons used two loss \nfunctions from the same paper.  \nWith this method it is not possible to use any detailed prior beliefs about the graph \nstructure. The user can only specify a prior distribution for 𝜓, the probability that each \nedge is present. Another possible disadvantage is that it is not possible to calculate \nanything about the posterior distribution exactly. In contrast, with the HIW prior there \nis an explicit formula for the posterior probabilities of decomposable graphs.  \n\n3 Structure-learning for GGMs \n \n 24 \n3.2 \nFrequentist methods  \nPreamble \nThere are also various frequentist methods for GGM structure-learning. These produce \na single graph rather than a distribution over a set of graphs. Albieri (2010) is a review \nand comparison of some of the main frequentist methods. Three of these are described \nbelow. See also Dobra et al (2004), Castelo & Roverato (2006), and chapter 20 of Koller \n& Friedman (2009).  \nSome of the many methods for DAG structure-learning may be suitable for GGMs. See \nfor example chapter 18 of Koller & Friedman (2009) or Gasse et al (2012). There has \nalso been various research on estimating the covariance matrix that makes little or no \nmention of graphs or graphical models, for example Yang & Berger (1994), Liechty et al \n(2004), or Bickel & Levina (2008).  \nThe simple frequentist method \nThis method is described by Albieri (2010) on pages 20–21. Find the sample covariance \nmatrix, invert it to find the sample precision matrix, and then standardize (see section \n2.3) to find the sample negative partial correlation matrix. Draw an edge between each \npair of nodes if and only if the magnitude of their sample partial correlation is above a \ncertain threshold. The appropriate threshold can be calculated using the fact that if the \ntrue partial correlation between two nodes is zero, then the sample partial correlation \nfollows a 𝑡-distribution (Lauritzen 1996, section 5.2.2; Albieri 2010, section 3.3.3), and \nusing multiple-testing procedures as described by Drton & Perlman (2007).  \nThe problem is that when 𝑛< 𝑝, the sample covariance matrix is singular and cannot \nnecessarily be inverted. Formerly, the standard methods for graphical model structure-\nlearning were greedy stepwise forward-selection and backward-elimination—see \nWhittaker (1990, section 8.4) or Edwards (1995, sections 6.1–6.2). But these fail to \naccount for multiple testing (Edwards 1995, page 138).  \nThe shrinkage / empirical Bayes method \nThis method was proposed in Schäfer & Strimmer (2005a,b). To estimate the \ncovariance matrix, they use a linear “shrinkage” of the unbiased estimator towards a \ndiagonal estimator in which the variances are not necessarily equal (Schäfer & \nStrimmer 2005b). This shrinkage estimator is always positive-definite, so it can be \ninverted to find estimators of the precision and partial correlation matrices.  \nThe next step is to test the partial correlations. The distribution of the estimated partial \ncorrelations is claimed to be similar to the exact distribution (Hotelling 1953), which \nappears in the maximum likelihood method. The number of degrees of freedom for this \ndistribution is estimated from the data—this is the “empirical Bayes” step (Schäfer & \nStrimmer 2005a). This ultimately gives a threshold to which the estimated partial \ncorrelations are compared to decide which edges are present in the graph.  \n\n \n3.2 Frequentist methods \n \n25 \nLasso-type methods \nThe “lasso” (Tibshirani 1996) is a method for estimating coefficients in standard linear \nmodels. Let {𝑦𝑖} be the observations, {𝑥𝑖𝑗} be the observed covariates, and {𝛽𝑗} be the \nregression coefficients, and assume that 𝑦̅ = 0. The coefficients are chosen to minimize \nthe residual sum of squares  \n∑(𝑦𝑖−∑𝛽𝑗𝑥𝑖𝑗\n𝑗\n)\n2\n𝑖\n \nsubject to ‖𝛽‖1 ≤𝑡. Here 𝑡 is a tuning parameter and ‖𝛽‖1 is the 𝐿1 norm of 𝛽, which is \n∑|𝛽𝑗|\n𝑗\n. This method often gives coefficients that are exactly zero, which means that the \ncorresponding covariates do not appear in the model.  \nSeveral methods inspired by the lasso have been proposed for GGM structure-learning. \nMeinshausen & Bühlmann (2006) proposed a “neighbourhood selection” method. For \neach node 𝑖, do lasso regression with 𝑋𝑖 as the observation and all the other nodes \n 𝑋𝑉\\{𝑖,𝑗} as covariates; the nodes for which the regression coefficients are non-zero are \ntaken to be the estimated neighbourhood of 𝑖 in the graph. To estimate the whole graph \nstructure, the edge (𝑖, 𝑗) is claimed to be present if and only if 𝑖 is in the estimated \nneighbourhood of 𝑗 and vice versa—alternatively, the same thing but with “or vice versa”.  \nFriedman et al (2007) present a method that gives estimates of the graph structure and \nthe whole of the precision matrix. The idea is to maximize the log-likelihood penalized \nby the 𝐿1 norm of 𝐾,  \nlog|𝐾| −tr(𝑆𝐾) −𝜌‖𝐾‖1 , \nover non-negative-definite matrices 𝐾. Here 𝐾= Σ−1, 𝑆 is the empirical covariance \nmatrix, 𝜌 is a tuning parameter, |𝐾| is the determinant, and ‖𝐾‖1 = ∑|𝐾𝑖𝑗|\n𝑖,𝑗\n (this sigma \nmeans a sum). This is equivalent to a minimization problem that resembles a lasso \nproblem as in Tibshirani (1996)—see Banerjee et al (2008) for details. Friedman et al \n(2007)’s contribution is the “graphical lasso algorithm” for solving the minimization \nproblem. This gives an estimate of Σ that can be inverted reasonably fast to give an \nestimate of 𝐾. Their experiments suggest that their algorithm is much faster than the \nrival one in Banerjee et al (2008), but the computation time depends greatly on 𝑝.  \nYuan & Lin (2007) set out to maximize the same penalized log-likelihood, except that \nthey omit the diagonal elements of 𝐾 from the penalty. Meinshausen (2008) shows that \nthis method is not consistent for estimating the graph structure. For a certain graph and \ncovariance matrix, it gives the wrong graph structure in the “population case”, where \nthe MLE of the covariance equals the true covariance, and with positive probability in \nthe case of finite samples.  \nFinding hubs \nAlbieri (2010) compared the shrinkage / empirical Bayes method, the graphical lasso, \nand the PC algorithm of Kalisch & Bühlmann (2007), which is for structure-learning of \ndirected acyclic graphical models. She found that none of these algorithms was good at \ndiscovering hubs. Instead of finding hubs, these algorithms found that the hub and all \nthe nodes it is connected to were all connected, making a large complete subgraph.  \n\n \n26 \n4 \nCorrections to an algorithm for \nrecursive thinning \n4.1 \nMaximal prime decomposition and minimal triangulation \nThis chapter presents corrections to a graph-manipulation algorithm known as \nrecursive thinning. First it is necessary to explain minimal triangulation.  \nSection 3.1 described Bayesian structure-learning of GGMs with the generalized hyper \ninverse Wishart (G-Wishart) prior distribution on Σ. In this framework, finding the \nmarginal likelihood of a given graph requires finding its maximal prime decomposition. \nOlesen & Madsen (2002) is about how to find the maximal prime decomposition of a \ndirected graph. The same process works for undirected graphs, except that one step, \n“moralization”, is omitted.  \nThe first step in finding the maximal prime decomposition is to find a minimal triangu-\nlation, which is defined as follows. Let (𝑉, 𝐸) be a finite undirected graph. A triangu-\nlation of (𝑉, 𝐸) is a set of extra edges 𝑇, often called fill edges, such that 𝐸∩𝑇= ∅ and \n(𝑉, 𝐸∪𝑇) is triangulated. As stated in section 2.1, triangulated graphs are the same as \ndecomposable or chordal graphs. A minimal triangulation is one such that removing \nany edge makes it no longer a triangulation. (Minimal triangulation is not necessary for \ngraphs that are already decomposable, but I am describing the general process.) \nMinimal triangulations are not the same as minimum triangulations; the latter are \ntriangulations for which there are no triangulations with fewer edges. Finding \nminimum triangulations is NP-hard (as proved in Yannakakis 1981).  \nThere are numerous algorithms to find minimal triangulations. Heggernes (2006) is a \nhistory and survey of these algorithms. She divides them into two main categories, \nbased on two different characterizations of triangulated graphs: (a) they have perfect \nelimination orders, and (b) every minimal separator is a clique. She gives brief \nexplanations of five or so algorithms in each category.  \nThe first algorithms for minimal triangulation were published in 1976. Two of these \ntake time 𝑂(𝑚𝑛) = 𝑂(𝑛3), where 𝑛 is the number of nodes and 𝑚 is the number of \nedges of the untriangulated graph. Algorithms based on the separator-based character-\nization started to appear in the 1990s, and many more algorithms have appeared since \nthen. Heggernes (2006) makes no mention of graphical models or statistics, except for a \ncursory citation of a 1988 paper by Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter. The main applications \nthat she mentions are sparse matrix computations (not in a way that is directly relevant \nto graphical models) and solving systems of sparse linear equations.  \n\n \n4.2 Recursive thinning \n \n27 \nHeggernes (2006) also discusses a third class of ways to create a minimal triangulation: \ncreate a triangulation that is not necessarily minimal, and then remove excess edges to \ncreate a minimal triangulation. In this approach, the usual way to create a triangulation \nis elimination (which she calls Elimination Game). This works as follows. Put the nodes \nin some order, the “elimination ordering”; for each node in turn, add edges as necessary \nto make all the neighbours of the node be connected to each other, and then remove the \nnode and all its incident edges. The triangulation consists of all the edges that are added \nduring this loop. Heggernes gives four algorithms for finding a minimal triangulation by \nremoving excess extra edges from a triangulation that was created using elimination.  \nThere are many possible ways to choose an elimination ordering. It can even be chosen \nas the algorithm progresses. One popular ordering is “minimum degree”, where at each \nstep you choose the remaining node that has the smallest degree (or one of these nodes, \nif there are more than one). This often creates minimal triangulations straight away, but \nnot always.  \nFor a slightly different use of triangulation in statistics or machine-learning, see Meilǎ & \nJordan (1997).  \n4.2 \nRecursive thinning \nThe R package “gRbase” (Dethlefsen & Højsgaard 2005) includes a function called mini-\nmalTriang, which performs minimal triangulation. The main argument to this function \nis the graph for which a minimal triangulation is desired. As an optional argument, a \ntriangulation can be supplied; if it is not, then one is created using a function called \ntriangulate. The main body of minimalTriang is an algorithm that removes excess extra \nedges from the triangulation to create a minimal triangulation.  \nThe documentation for minimalTriang cites Olesen & Madsen (2002)—this is true as of \nFebruary 2013, when the most recent version of gRbase was version 1.6-7. The relevant \npart of Olesen & Madsen (2002) is 2, and the source of the algorithm is cited as \nKjaerulff (1993). The relevant part of Kjaerulff (1993) is chapter 1, which is the same as \nchapters 1 and 2 of Kjaerulff (1990), so I will just refer to the earlier document.  \nKjaerulff (1990) and Olesen & Madsen (2002) both call the algorithm “recursive \nthinning”. Only Kjaerulff (1990)’s version of it is recursive, meaning that it calls itself. \nOlesen & Madsen (2002)’s version uses a Repeat loop and is not recursive, but it is \nessentially the same. In this chapter I will present non-recursive versions of algorithms, \nbecause I think these are easier to understand.  \nBoth Kjaerulff (1990) and Olesen & Madsen (2002) claim that the algorithm works on \nany triangulation, not just ones created by elimination. However, the algorithm as given \nin these two publications is not correct, even for triangulations created by elimination. \nThis chapter is concerned with correcting the algorithm for recursive thinning.  \nThe next sections present the incorrect recursive thinning algorithm, Algorithm I, and \nthen two corrected versions, Algorithms II and III, and proofs that these are correct. \nThe R function minimalTriang actually performs Algorithm III, not the incorrect \n\n4 Corrections to an algorithm for recursive thinning \n \n 28 \nalgorithm cited in its documentation. Algorithm II is a simplified version of Algorithm \nIII.  \nIt appears that Kjaerulff (1990) is not well known. Heggernes (2006) states that “In \n1996, Blair et al … posed and solved the problem of making a given triangulation \nminimal by removing edges.” The reference is to Blair et al (2001), but this is precisely \nthe problem addressed by Kjaerulff (1990).  \n4.3 \nNotation \nI use a simplified version of the notation in Kjaerulff (1990) and Olesen & Madsen \n(2002). The list below gives my notation, the notation used in these two papers, and the \nvariable names in the R code for minimalTriang, to make it easy to compare the \ndifferent versions of the algorithms.  \n• \nThe given graph is (𝑉, 𝐸). \n• \n𝑇 is the triangulation. Its initial value is the triangulation that is given as input to the \nalgorithm. (This is called 𝑇 in Olesen & Madsen 2002 and TT in minimalTriang.)  \n• \n𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸∪𝑇) is the triangulated version of the graph.  \n• \nIn Algorithm I, 𝑈 is the set of edges that get removed on this iteration of the Repeat \nloop. (This is called 𝑇′ in Kjaerulff 1990 and Olesen & Madsen 2002.)  \n• \nIn Algorithm III, 𝑅⊆𝑇 is the set of edges that are candidates for removal. Edges are \nsometimes added to 𝑅. (This is called 𝑅′ in Kjaerulff 1990 and Olesen & Madsen \n2002, and Rn in minimalTriang.)  \n• \nIn Algorithm III, 𝐵 is the set of nodes at the end of edges that have been removed on \nthis iteration of the Repeat loop. (In minimalTriang, exclT is first the set of edges \nthat have been removed on this iteration, and then this set of nodes.)  \n𝑇, 𝐺, 𝑅, and 𝐵 all change during the algorithm. 𝑇 and 𝐺 always change at the same time, \nso it is always true that 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸∪𝑇).  \n4.4 \nThe incorrect algorithm \nAlgorithm I is the incorrect algorithm as given in Olesen & Madsen (2002). (Kjaerulff’s \nalgorithm starts with 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸∪𝑇), whereas Olesen & Madsen start with 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸); I \nthink this is a minor oversight in the latter.)  \n \nAlgorithm I: an incorrect method for recursive thinning \n1.

Until 𝑈= ∅.  \n7. Return 𝑇. \n \n\n \n4.5 How the incorrect algorithm goes wrong \n \n29 \nLine 5 sets 𝑅 to be the set of remaining extra edges that share a node with one or more \nof the edges that was removed on this iteration of the Repeat loop. Line 9 in Algorithm \nIII does the same thing, though it is written differently. (There is no analogous line in \nAlgorithm II.)  \n4.5 \nHow the incorrect algorithm goes wrong \nThe fundamental problem with Algorithm I is that it removes more than one edge at a \ntime, instead of updating the graph after each individual edge-removal and checking \nwhether the other edges can still be removed. Algorithms II and III work correctly \nbecause they update 𝑇 and 𝐺 after each individual edge-removal.  \nThe simplest example of a triangulation for which Algorithm I does not work is Figure \n4.1(a), where the solid lines are the edges in 𝐸 and the dashed lines are the edges in 𝑇. \nThe algorithm removes both edges at the first step.  \nKjaerulff (1990) and Olesen & Madsen (2002) state that the algorithm works on any \ntriangulation, but they seem to have in mind triangulations produced by elimination. \nThe simplest such triangulation for which it does not work is shown in Figure 4.1(b). \nAny elimination ordering that starts with the node at the bottom would produce this \ntriangulation.  \nThis is not minimum-degree elimination—the bottom node has the highest degree. \nHowever, the algorithm can also fail on triangulations created by minimum-degree \nelimination. An example graph can be constructed as follows. Start with the five-node \ngraph in Figure 4.1(b). For each node except the bottom one, add a clique of 10 nodes \nthat intersects with the original graph only at that node. The new nodes have degree 9, \nthe bottom node still has degree 4, and the other four nodes now have degree 12. \nMinimum-degree elimination will start with the bottom node and produce the two \nextra edges shown in Figure 4.1(b) (as well as many others), and Algorithm I will fail.  \n \n(a) \n \n \n(b) \n \nFigure 4.1. Two graphs, shown with solid lines, and triangulations of them, shown with dashed \nlines. (a) A triangulation for which Algorithm I does not work. (b) A triangulation produced by \nelimination for which Algorithm I does not work.  \n \n\n4 Corrections to an algorithm for recursive thinning \n \n 30 \nSimilarly, probably any other rule for choosing an elimination ordering will in some \ncases lead to the failure of the algorithm. For example, the algorithm will fail in any \ngraph where the graph in Figure 4.1(b) appears as an induced subgraph and the bottom \nnode comes first in the elimination ordering.  \nIncidentally, although Kjaerulff (1990) makes it clear, using unambiguous English and \nstandard notation, that his algorithm checks all the extra edges on the first run, in one \nexample (on pages 11–12) he checks the edges one at a time.  \n4.6 \nA correct algorithm \nAlgorithm II: a correct method for recursive thinning \n1. Put the edges in 𝑇 in some arbitrary order.  \n2. Repeat  \n3.  \nFor each edge (𝑥, 𝑦) ∈𝑇 in turn, in order, \n4.  \n \nIf 𝐺(𝑛𝑒(𝑥) ∩𝑛𝑒(𝑦)) is complete (in 𝐺) \n5.  \n \n \nRemove (𝑥, 𝑦) (from 𝑇 and 𝐺). \n6. Until “no edges were removed this time”.  \n7. Return 𝑇. \n \nA preliminary result for proving the correctness of Algorithm II \nAssuming that 𝐺 is triangulated, say that the edge (𝑥, 𝑦) ∈𝑇 is “removable” from the \ncurrent 𝑇 if removing it does not make 𝐺 become untriangulated.  \nProposition 4.1. (𝑥, 𝑦) ∈𝑇 is removable if and only if the condition in line 4 of \nAlgorithm II is fulfilled. \nProof. Suppose the condition in line 4 is not fulfilled. There must be nodes 𝑎 and 𝑏 such \nthat {(𝑥, 𝑎), (𝑎, 𝑦), (𝑦, 𝑏), (𝑏, 𝑥)} ⊆𝐸∪𝑇 and (𝑎, 𝑏) ∉𝐸∪𝑇. Removing (𝑥, 𝑦)  would \nmake there be a chordless cycle of length four, 𝑥–𝑎–𝑦–𝑏–𝑥, which would mean that 𝐺 \nwould no longer be triangulated. So the condition in line 4 is necessary for (𝑥, 𝑦) to be \nremovable.  \nNow suppose the condition in line 4 is fulfilled. Firstly, suppose that removing (𝑥, 𝑦) \nmakes there be a chordless cycle of length 5 or more. Then there must have been a \nchordless cycle of length 4 or more before (𝑥, 𝑦) was removed. But 𝐺 was triangulated, \nso this is impossible. Secondly, suppose that removing (𝑥, 𝑦) causes the appearance of a \nchordless cycle of length 4, say 𝑥–𝑎–𝑦–𝑏–𝑥, where (𝑎, 𝑏) ∉𝐸∪𝑇. This is impossible, \nbecause it contradicts the condition in line 4. So removing (𝑥, 𝑦) does not lead to the \nappearance of any chordless cycles of length 4 or more. This shows that the condition in \nline 4 is sufficient for (𝑥, 𝑦) to be removable.   \nSo in Algorithm II, the For loop simply checks each edge in 𝑇 in turn, and removes the \nedge if it is removable.  \n\n \n4.7 A second correct algorithm \n \n31 \nProof of correctness for Algorithm II \nI will use the word “run” to refer to a single iteration of the Repeat loop. It suffices to \nprove that (a) the final 𝑇 is a triangulation, (b) this triangulation is minimal, and (c) the \nalgorithm finishes in finite time.  \n(a) 𝐺 is triangulated to start with, by definition. It is only ever modified by the removal \nof an edge, which happens when the condition in line 4 is fulfilled. 𝐺 remains triangu-\nlated after every such removal, by Proposition 4.1. Therefore 𝐺 is always triangulated \nand 𝑇 is always a triangulation.  \n(b) On the final run, the algorithm checks the condition in line 4 for every edge in 𝑇, and \nfinds that it is not fulfilled for any of them. By Proposition 4.1, this means that removing \nany of the edges in 𝑇 would make 𝐺 become untriangulated. In other words, the \ntriangulation is minimal.  \n(c) Let 𝑡 be the initial number of edges in 𝑇. On each run except the last, the Repeat loop \nremoves at least one edge. So the largest number of times that the Repeat loop can be \ncarried out is 𝑡+ 1, which is finite. On each run, the For loop checks all the remaining \nedges in 𝑇. On the 𝑖th run, the remaining number of edges in 𝑇 is at most 𝑡−𝑖+ 1. This \nis also finite, so the algorithm is certain to finish in finite time.   \n4.7 \nA second correct algorithm \nAlgorithm III: a second correct method for recursive thinning \n1. Put the edges in 𝑇 in some arbitrary order (minimalTriang uses lexicographic order).  \n2. Set 𝑅= 𝑇. \n3. Repeat \n4.  \nSet 𝐵= ∅. \n5.  \nFor each edge (𝑥, 𝑦) ∈𝑅 in turn, in order,  \n6.  \n \nIf 𝐺(𝑛𝑒(𝑥) ∩𝑛𝑒(𝑦)) is complete (in 𝐺) \n7.  \n \n \nRemove (𝑥, 𝑦) (from 𝑇 and 𝐺) \n8.  \n \n \nAdd 𝑥 and 𝑦 to 𝐵  \n9.  \nSet 𝑅= {(𝑥, 𝑦) ∈𝑇: 𝑥∈𝐵 or 𝑦∈𝐵}  \n10. Until 𝐵= ∅.  \n11. Return 𝑇. \n \nAn example of how Algorithms II and III are different \nFigure 4.2 shows an example of how Algorithms II and III sometimes do not remove the \nsame edges as each other on every run. On the first run, Algorithm III does not include \n①–③ in 𝑅, so on the second run it misses the chance to remove this edge.  \nThe intention of Algorithm I \nIn Algorithm I, the idea of 𝑅 was that you can save time by not checking edges that you \nknow cannot be removed (Kjaerulff 1990). The same concept is used in Algorithm III, \nwhich is a corrected version of Algorithm I. The idea is that on the next run there is no \n\n4 Corrections to an algorithm for recursive thinning \n \n 32 \npoint checking edges for which the sets of neighbours of the two nodes did not change \non this run—because even if you check these edges, they will not be removed.  \nBut this idea is mistaken, because the sets of neighbours sometimes change from one \niteration of the For loop to the next. And if the sets of neighbours change, then it may \nbecome possible to remove the edge. This is illustrated in Figure 4.2. For both \nalgorithms, when the second run starts, the sets of neighbours for ①–③ are the same \nas in the first run. But in Algorithm II when the For loop gets round to checking ①–③, \nthe neighbours have changed and the edge gets removed.  \nFigure 4.2 also shows that in Algorithm III it is possible for an edge to be excluded from \n𝑅 but later reappear in it and be removed.  \n \n \nFigure 4.2. A graph and a triangulation for which Algorithms II and III do not remove the same \nextra edges on each run. The solid edges are the graph and the dashed edges are the extra edges. \nOn each run the edges are checked are checked in the order ①–②, ①–③, ②–⑤. Each \nalgorithm also does one final run, which is not shown, in which no edges are removed. (The \ngraph itself is already triangulated, so the triangulation is pointless, but this is just an example \nfor illustration.)  \n \n\n \n4.7 A second correct algorithm \n \n33 \nProof of correctness for Algorithm III \nAgain I will use “run” to refer to a single iteration of the Repeat loop.  \nAlgorithm III is the same as Algorithm II, except that on each run Algorithm II checks all \nthe edges in 𝑇, whereas Algorithm III only checks the edges in 𝑅, which is always the \nsame as 𝑇 or a subset of it. When the For loop finishes, 𝐵 is the set of nodes such that \nedges incident to them have been removed during the current run. So line 9 has the \neffect of ensuring that if (𝑥, 𝑦) ∈𝑇∖𝑅 then neither 𝑛𝑒(𝑥) nor 𝑛𝑒(𝑦) changed during the \ncurrent run, which means that 𝑛𝑒(𝑥) ∩𝑛𝑒(𝑦) did not change during the current run. \nThe contrapositive of this is that if 𝑛𝑒(𝑥) ∩𝑛𝑒(𝑦) changed during the current run, then \n(𝑥, 𝑦) ∈𝑅. (The converse is not true—sometimes line 9 puts (𝑥, 𝑦) in 𝑅 even though \n𝑛𝑒(𝑥) ∩𝑛𝑒(𝑦) did not change during the current run.)  \nLine 10 in Algorithm III is the same as line 6 in Algorithm II. The equivalence of the \nother parts of the two algorithms is obvious.  \nIt suffices to prove that on the final run of Algorithm III, the edges that are not checked \nare not removable. The proof will work by considering an edge (𝑥, 𝑦) that does not get \nchecked on the final run, and looking back through the runs to find the last run where it \nwas checked. When (𝑥, 𝑦) was last checked, it was obviously found to be unremovable. \nIt will be shown that after that 𝑛𝑒(𝑥) ∩𝑛𝑒(𝑦) never changed, from which it follows that \n(𝑥, 𝑦) is not removable during the final run.  \nSuppose that (𝑥, 𝑦) does not get checked on the final run, and say this run was the 𝑖th. \nJust after line 9 on the (𝑖−1)th run, (𝑥, 𝑦) must have been in 𝑇∖𝑅. This means that \n𝑛𝑒(𝑥) ∩𝑛𝑒(𝑦) did not change during the (𝑖−1)th run.  \nEither (a) (𝑥, 𝑦) was checked during the (𝑖−1)th run, or (b) it was not. If (a), then \n𝐺(𝑛𝑒(𝑥) ∩𝑛𝑒(𝑦)) must have been found to be incomplete, otherwise (𝑥, 𝑦) would have \nbeen removed from 𝑇. Since 𝑛𝑒(𝑥) ∩𝑛𝑒(𝑦) did not change during this run, even if (𝑥, 𝑦) \nwas checked on the final run then 𝐺(𝑛𝑒(𝑥) ∩𝑛𝑒(𝑦)) would still be found to be \nincomplete (since edges are never added to 𝐺). In other words, during the final run, \n(𝑥, 𝑦) is not removable.  \nIf (b), then (𝑥, 𝑦) must have been in 𝑇∖𝑅 just after line 9 in the (𝑖−2)th run. This \nmeans that 𝑛𝑒(𝑥) ∩𝑛𝑒(𝑦) did not change during the (𝑖−2)th run. Either (a2) (𝑥, 𝑦) \nwas checked during the (𝑖−2)th run, or (b2) it was not. If (a2), then 𝐺(𝑛𝑒(𝑥) ∩𝑛𝑒(𝑦)) \nmust have been found to be incomplete during the (𝑖−2)th run. It is now known that \n𝑛𝑒(𝑥) ∩𝑛𝑒(𝑦) did not change during the (𝑖−2)th or (𝑖−1)th runs. It follows that \n𝐺(𝑛𝑒(𝑥) ∩𝑛𝑒(𝑦)) is still incomplete after line 9 in the (𝑖−1)th run, so on the final run \n(𝑥, 𝑦) is not removable.  \nIf (b2), then (𝑥, 𝑦) must have been in 𝑇∖𝑅 just after line 9 in the (𝑖−3)th run. This \nreasoning can be continued backwards through the runs. All the edges were checked on \nthe first run, so eventually this search backwards through the runs is certain to find a \nrun where (𝑥, 𝑦) was checked and 𝐺(𝑛𝑒(𝑥) ∩𝑛𝑒(𝑦)) was found to be incomplete; and \n𝑛𝑒(𝑥) ∩𝑛𝑒(𝑦) has not changed since this run—if it had changed, (𝑥, 𝑦) would have \nbeen put in 𝑅 and checked on the next run. It follows that 𝐺(𝑛𝑒(𝑥) ∩𝑛𝑒(𝑦)) is still not \n\n4 Corrections to an algorithm for recursive thinning \n \n 34 \ncomplete after line 9 in the (𝑖−1)th run, so even if (𝑥, 𝑦) were checked on the 𝑖th run it \nwould not be removed.   \n4.8 \nComments on the two correct algorithms \nUnderlying the two proofs is the result, quoted in Heggernes (2006), that “if 𝐺⊂𝐻 for \ntwo chordal graphs 𝐺 and 𝐻 on the same vertex set, then there is a sequence of edges \nthat can be removed from 𝐻 one by one, such that the resulting graph after each \nremoval is chordal, until we reach 𝐺.” This explains why it is sensible to remove one \nedge at a time.  \nThe edges can be checked in different orders on different runs. The proofs make no \nassumptions about these orders. However, it is natural in writing a computer program \nto make it check the edges in the same order on every run. \nThe R function minimalTriang performs Algorithm III plus various checks. For example, \nit checks whether (𝑉, 𝐸) is triangulated at the start and whether 𝐺 is triangulated at the \nend. The test in line 10 of Algorithm III is actually done before line 9, and if the result is \ntrue then the process breaks out of the Repeat loop.  \n4.9 \nWhich of the correct algorithms is faster? \nIn the example in Figure 4.2, Algorithm II is faster than Algorithm III. Algorithm II can \nalso be faster for a triangulation produced by minimum-degree elimination. An example \ncan be constructed from the original graph in Figure 4.2 (the graph with the four solid \nedges). Add two nodes that are connected to each other and node 5, and add two nodes \nthat are connected to each other and node 2. One possible minimum-degree elimination \nbegins by eliminating nodes 4, 3, and 1 and creates the same three extra edges as in \nFigure 4.2. Algorithms II and III proceed in the same way as in Figure 4.2, and \nAlgorithm II is faster.  \nOn the other hand, Algorithm III is sometimes faster than Algorithm II, even with \ntriangulations produced by minimum-degree elimination ordering. Again consider the \ngraph and the triangulation shown at the top of Figure 4.2, or the ones described in the \nprevious paragraph. But this time suppose the edges are checked in the order 1–3, 1–2, \n2–5. On the first run both algorithms remove 2–5, on the second run they both remove \n1–2, and on the third run they both remove 1–3. But on the second run, Algorithm III \nsaves time by not checking 1–3. This makes it faster overall, assuming that creating 𝐵 \nand 𝑅 does not take any time.  \nKjaerulff (1990) recommends checking the edges in the reverse of the order in which \nthey were added during the elimination-ordering algorithm. It is not clear whether one \nof the two correct algorithms is always faster than the other if this advice is followed.  \nI carried out an experimental comparison of the two correct algorithms in R, using \nsimplified versions of minimalTriang. To test the two algorithms it is necessary to \ncreate triangulations. The R function triangulate uses a version of minimum-degree \nelimination ordering that very often creates a minimal triangulation straight away, so \nthat the recursive thinning algorithm has nothing to do. So I wrote a simpler triangu-\n\n \n4.10 What is the best algorithm for minimal triangulation? \n \n35 \nlation function that does elimination with the nodes in their natural order. The idea was \nthat this would create non-minimal triangulations more often.  \nI created 100,000 random non-decomposable graphs on 30 nodes, by choosing them \nuniformly at random from among all such graphs, with replacement. I then created \ntriangulations of all these graphs and ran the two programs on the graphs and their \ntriangulations. Algorithm II took 767 seconds of CPU time and Algorithm III took 830 \nseconds.  \n4.10 What is the best algorithm for minimal triangulation? \nHeggernes (2006) reports that the fastest known algorithm for minimal triangulation is \n𝑜(𝑛2.376), where 𝑛 is the number of nodes. This algorithm appears in Heggernes et al \n(2005). The fastest algorithms are rather complicated, and their high asymptotic \nspeeds rely on the detailed manipulations being done in specially fast ways.  \nIf a fast algorithm was wanted, my personal choice would be MCS-M (Berry et al 2004). \nThis has asymptotic speed 𝑂(𝑚𝑛), where 𝑚 is the number of edges of the untriangu-\nlated graph. MCS-M is not especially simple, since it requires searching along paths \nwhere the nodes fulfil a certain condition. This is more complicated to program than \nmerely checking whether the neighbours of a node are connected, which is how Algo-\nrithms II and III work. Unless speed is paramount, it seems sensible to use minimum-\ndegree elimination followed by Algorithm II or III to remove excess edges, especially as \nminimum-degree elimination often produces minimal triangulations straight away.  \nR is much slower than general-purpose programming languages, so there would be no \npoint in rewriting minimalTriang to use an algorithm that is theoretically or \nasymptotically superior. If speed was important, it would be more sensible to rewrite \ntriangulate or the main body of minimalTriang in C or Fortran and call these from R, or \nabandon R and use a different programming language.  \n \n \n\n \n36 \n5 \nRandom graph distributions \n5.1 \nTwo ways of looking at graph distributions \nBayesian structure-learning of graphical models involves probability distributions on \nsets of graphs. One of the first steps for the user is to specify a prior distribution that \naccords with their beliefs about which graphs are more or less likely. This chapter is \nabout probability distributions on graphs and in particular about prior distributions in \nBayesian structure-learning.  \nThere are two ways of looking at or defining probability distributions on sets of graphs. \nThe first is that you have a set of graphs and a formula that can be applied to any of \nthese graphs to give its probability, or its unnormalized probability. Obviously the \nprobabilities are all non-negative and sum to 1. This I will call a “graph distribution”. \nThe second is a “random graph model”, which is essentially a random or partly random \nprocedure for constructing a graph.  \nAny probability distribution on a set of graphs can be defined in either of these two \nways. But in practice the two ways of looking at these distributions are different. If you \nare given a graph distribution, it may be difficult to generate a graph from it. Conversely, \nif you are given a random graph model, it may be difficult to calculate the probability of \na given graph.  \nIf you have a graph distribution, MCMC can be used to generate a sample of graphs that \napproximately follow the distribution. The acceptance probability for moving from 𝐺 to \n𝐺′ is  \nmin {1,  𝑝(𝐺′)\n𝑝(𝐺)\n𝑞(𝐺′ →𝐺)\n𝑞(𝐺→𝐺′)} , \nwhere 𝑝 is the graph distribution and 𝑞(𝐺1 →𝐺2) is the probability of proposing to \nmove to 𝐺2 if the current graph is 𝐺1. In principle, the proposal distribution 𝑞 can be \nchosen arbitrarily as long as the Markov chain is irreducible and aperiodic.  \nWhen dealing with prior distributions for graphical model structure-learning, it is \nnecessary to calculate the probability of a given graph, so it is natural to work with \ngraph distributions rather than random graph models. However, you might also want to \nbe able to generate from the distribution, for example to empirically evaluate whether it \nencourages hubs.  \nGraph distributions have been the subject of some research in the context of graphical \nmodel structure-learning. But random graph models have been the subject of far more \n\n \n5.2 Erdős–Rényi random graphs \n \n37 \nresearch, in other contexts, as described in the next two sections. In this chapter, the \nnumber of nodes in the graph is 𝑛.  \n5.2 \nErdős–Rényi random graphs  \nThe first random graph models to be studied in depth were Erdős–Rényi graphs. These \ntwo models will be referred to in several sections of this chapter and in section 6.2. The \nfirst Erdős–Rényi model is 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑝), in which there are 𝑛 nodes and each edge appears \nindependently with probability 𝑝, and the second is 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑀), where there are 𝑛 nodes \nand 𝑀 edges and all such graphs have equal probability. 𝑀 and 𝑝 are usually 𝑀(𝑛) and \n𝑝(𝑛), functions of 𝑛. The first Erdős–Rényi model was introduced in Gilbert (1959) and \nthe second was introduced in Erdős & Rényi (1959).  \nErdős–Rényi random graph theory is covered in depth by Bollobás (2001). It is mainly \nconcerned with approximating the proportion of graphs that have a certain property \nand seeing what happens as 𝑛→∞. In many cases, either almost every graph has the \nproperty (in other words, the proportion of graphs with the property tends to 1 as 𝑛→\n∞) or almost every graph does not have the property. The preface of Bollobás (2001) \nsays that the main omission from this book is probably random trees, which are \ncovered in chapter 7 of Moon (1970).  \nThe notations 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑝) and 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑀) may seem ambiguous, because the second parameter \nhas two possible meanings, but it is uncommon to write specific numbers or formulas \ninside the brackets. Alternative notations include 𝒢𝑝, 𝒢(𝑝), 𝒢𝑛,𝑝, and 𝒢𝑛,𝑚. 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑝) is \nsometimes called the Bernoulli random graph or the binomial model, and 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑀) is \nsometimes called the uniform model (Janson et al 2000, page 2). For many questions, \nresults about these two different models are very similar. The two models are in certain \nsenses equivalent, as shown by Theorem 2.2 in Bollobás (2001) and a stronger result in \nŁuczak (1990).  \nErdős–Rényi graphs are clearly random graph models as defined in section 5.1. \nHowever, given an Erdős–Rényi model, it is also easy to calculate the probability of any \ngiven graph. So they could also be regarded as graph distributions.  \n5.3 \nComplex networks \n“Random graphs” is sometimes taken to mean Erdős–Rényi random graphs. An example \nof this usage is in Watts & Strogatz (1998). In Erdős–Rényi graphs, the node degrees \nfollow an approximate Poisson distribution, which means that most nodes have similar \ndegrees (Barabási & Oltvai 2004, Jeong et al 2000). Since the late 1990s a consensus \nhas emerged that these graphs are usually unsuitable for modelling networks in the real \nworld.  \nRandom graph models that are intended to model real-world networks have come to be \nknown as “complex networks”. Some research on complex networks is not mathe-\nmatically rigorous and instead demonstrates properties by means of experiments on \ncomputer. Examples of this type of research are Watts & Strogatz (1998) and Barabási \n& Albert (1999), which have both been highly influential. The range of random graph \n\n5 Random graph distributions \n \n 38 \nmodels or complex networks that have been proposed, studied, and used is discussed in \ndepth in Newman (2003).  \nOne random graph model discussed in Newman (2003) is the “scale-free” graphs of \nBarabási & Albert (1999). These are described in section 2.4, about biomolecular \nnetworks.  \nAnother random graph model that is currently the subject of research is the configu-\nration model. This starts with a fixed degree for each vertex. A random graph is \ngenerated by creating the appropriate number of half-edges for each node, and then \njoining the half-edges in pairs uniformly at random. Doing this can lead to self-edges \nand multi-edges, but asymptotically the proportion of these is small (Molloy & Reed \n1995).  \nThe configuration model is used to model social networks or networks of human \ncontact. These networks are then used for modelling the spread of epidemics—see for \nexample Andersson (1998) or Britton et al (2007, 2011). The configuration model has \nbeen used to prove asymptotic mathematical theorems about graphs that are chosen \nuniformly at random from among all those that have a given degree sequence (Molloy & \nReed 1995).  \nSimilar to the configuration model is the expected-degree model (Chung & Lu 2002a,b, \n2006; Chung et al 2003), in which each node 𝑣𝑖 has a weight 𝑤𝑖, and the edge (𝑣𝑖, 𝑣𝑗) is \npresent with probability 𝑤𝑖𝑤𝑗/∑𝑤𝑘, independent of all the other edges. If self-edges are \npermitted then 𝔼(deg(𝑣𝑖)) = 𝑤𝑖. For this model, the probability of a given graph can \neasily be calculated. The expected-degree model is an example of a factored distri-\nbution—see the next section.  \n5.4 \nFactored distributions \nDefinitions \nThis section is about a certain class of graph distributions that appears in several \ncontexts. I will refer to these as “factored” distributions (following Meilă & Jaakkola \n2006). The number of nodes is fixed. A factored distribution on a set of graphs is one \nwhere each edge has a weight, 𝑤𝑒, and the probability of each graph is proportional to \nthe product of the weights of the edges in that graph. In symbols, \n                                                                      ℙ(𝐺) ∝∏𝑤𝑒\n𝑒∈𝐸𝐺\n ,                                                           (1) \nfor 𝐺∈𝒢, where 𝒢 is the set of graphs under consideration; and ℙ(𝐺) = 0 for 𝐺∉𝒢. It \nwill be useful later to write the definition with an equals sign:  \n                                                             ℙ(𝐺) =\n∏\n𝑤𝑒\n𝑒∈𝐸𝐺\n∑\n∏\n𝑤𝑒\n𝑒∈𝐸𝐻\n𝐻∈𝒢\n .                                                       (2) \nLet 𝐸𝑎𝑙𝑙 be the set of all (𝑛\n2) possible edges. Any distribution where  \n\n \n5.4 Factored distributions \n \n39 \n                                                       ℙ(𝐺) ∝∏𝑝𝑒\n𝑒∈𝐸\n∏(1 −𝑝𝑒)\n𝑒∈𝐸𝑎𝑙𝑙∖𝐸\n ,                                             (3) \nfor some {𝑝𝑒}, is also factored, since this expression can be written as  \n∏\n𝑝𝑒\n1 −𝑝𝑒\n𝑒∈𝐸\n ∏(1 −𝑝𝑒) ∝ ∏\n𝑝𝑒\n1 −𝑝𝑒\n𝑒∈𝐸\n𝑒∈𝐸𝑎𝑙𝑙\n = ∏𝑤𝑒\n𝑒∈𝐸\n , \nwhere 𝑤𝑒= 𝑝𝑒/(1 −𝑝𝑒) (which is the odds that 𝑒∈𝐸 in the case described in the next \nsubsection).  \nThe set of all graphs \nLet 𝒢𝑎𝑙𝑙 be the set of all 2(𝑛\n2) graphs. If 𝒢= 𝒢𝑎𝑙𝑙, then factored distributions are ones \nwhere each edge is present or absent with a fixed probability and all these events are \nindependent. Moreover, 𝑝𝑒 is the probability that 𝑒∈𝐸 and 𝑤𝑒 is the odds of the same \nevent. To see these facts, use definition (3), and note that  \n∑{∏𝑝𝑒\n𝑒∈𝐸𝐺\n \n∏\n(1 −𝑝𝑒)\n𝑒∈𝐸𝑎𝑙𝑙∖𝐸𝐺\n}\n𝐺∈𝒢𝑎𝑙𝑙\n= ∏(𝑝𝑒+ (1 −𝑝𝑒))\n𝑒∈𝐸𝑎𝑙𝑙\n= 1 . \nIt follows that the proportional-to symbol in definition (3) can be replaced by an equals \nsign: \nℙ(𝐺) = ∏𝑝𝑒\n𝑒∈𝐸\n ∏(1 −𝑝𝑒)\n𝑒∉𝐸\n . \nThis is essentially the definition of the presence or absence of each edge being \nindependent.  \nTrees and forests \nIf 𝒢 is the set of forests or trees, then in a factored distribution the edges are not present \nor absent independently of each other, because the graph is constrained to be a forest \nor tree. This was pointed out by Meilă & Jaakkola (2006). \nIf 𝒢 is the set of trees, then the products in the numerator of (2) all have the same \nnumber of terms (namely 𝑛−1). So  \nℙ(𝐺) = ∏\n𝑤𝑒\n(∑\n∏\n𝑤𝑒\n𝑒∈𝐸𝐻\n𝐻∈𝒢\n)\n1/(𝑛−1)\n𝑒∈𝐸𝐺\n . \nThis now has the very simple form ℙ(𝐺) = ∏\n𝑤𝑒\n𝑒∈𝐸\n. (To convert to this form, replace \neach of the original 𝑤𝑒’s with 𝑤𝑒/(∑\n∏\n𝑤𝑒\n𝑒∈𝐸𝐻\n𝐻∈𝒢\n)1/(𝑛−1).) However, the form with the \nproportional-to symbol is more natural, since this is how factored distributions arise as \nprior distributions that are inferred from expert knowledge, as suggested by Madigan & \nRaftery (1994), and as posterior distributions.  \n\n5 Random graph distributions \n \n 40 \nUses of factored distributions \nFactored distributions are graph distributions, rather than random graph models. \nHowever, in the case that 𝒢= 𝒢𝑎𝑙𝑙, it is easy to generate from them, since all the edges \nare independent, so they could be regarded as random graph models.  \nThe use of factored distributions as prior distributions for graphical model structure-\nlearning seems to have been first proposed by Madigan & Raftery (1994). They suggest \ngetting an expert to estimate the probability of each edge being present and assuming \nthat the presences of the edges are mutually independent.  \nThe results in Meilă & Jaakkola (2006) are all about factored distributions on trees. For \nBayesian structure-learning of discrete-valued tree graphical models, they prove that \nunder certain assumptions the graph posterior is a factored distribution. Chapter 8 \ndescribes methods for analyzing factored distributions for trees, based on Meilă & \nJaakkola (2006), and methods for generating from these distributions. Section 7.4 \ndescribes how the Chow–Liu algorithm can be used if the prior is a factored \ndistribution on trees.  \n5.5 \nGraph priors that have been proposed \nPriors for undirected graphs \nIn Bayesian structure-learning it is necessary to be able to calculate the probability of a \ngiven graph, so in practice prior distributions are invariably defined as graph distri-\nbutions, rather than random graph models.  \nThe simplest type of graph prior distribution is the uniform distribution, where each of \nthe graphs under consideration is equally likely. Priors of this type have been used by \nCooper & Herskovits (1992), Madigan & Raftery (1994), Giudici (1996), Giudici & \nGreen (1999), Roverato (2002), Atay-Kayis & Massam (2005), Dobra et al (2011), \nWang & Li (2012), and others. If you are considering all graphs, or all decomposable \ngraphs, then the uniform distribution gives higher probability to medium graph sizes—\nthe “size” of a graph is the number of edges it has—than to small or large sizes (Giudici \n& Green 1999, Jones et al 2005, Carvalho & Scott 2009, Armstrong et al 2009).  \nFor undirected graphical models, several alternatives have been proposed in published \nresearch. One is the “size-based prior” of Armstrong et al (2009). In this distribution, \nnon-decomposable graphs have probability zero, all sizes are equally likely, and all \ndecomposable graphs of the same size are equally likely. They also propose a more \ngeneral hierarchical prior distribution in which the size has a binomial distribution, \nℙ(size = 𝑘) = ((𝑛\n2)\n𝑘) 𝜓𝑘(1 −𝜓)(𝑛\n2)−𝑘  for 𝑘= 0,1, … , (𝑛\n2), \nthe binomial parameter 𝜓 has a beta distribution, and again all decomposable graphs of \nthe same size are equally likely. If 𝜓< 0.5 then more probability is given to sparser \ngraphs.  \n\n \n5.5 Graph priors that have been proposed \n \n41 \nPart of the motivation for the size-based prior distribution was the belief that the graph \nis sparse. But the prior fails to reflect this belief in a sensible way, because it does not \ntake account of how many graphs there are that have each size. For example, it often \ngives lower probability to each of the graphs of size (𝑛\n2) −1 than to the complete graph. \nMore probability is assigned to the size (𝑛\n2) −1, but it gets shared out among many \ngraphs. Any sensible “sparsity-encouraging” prior would surely give higher probability \nto any graph of size 𝑘−1 than to any graph of size 𝑘, especially in the case 𝑘= 𝑛. \nConsequently it does not seem sensible to assign a probability to a size without taking \ninto account how many graphs have that size.  \nDobra et al (2004) and Jones et al (2005) use ℙ(𝐺) = 𝛽|𝐸𝐺|(1 −𝛽)(𝑛\n2)−|𝐸𝐺|, where 𝛽∈\n[0,1]. When all graphs are being considered, this is the first Erdős–Rényi graph model, \nwhere each edge is present independently with probability 𝛽. When only decomposable \ngraphs are being considered, it is not. Jones et al (2005) call this the Bernoulli prior but \nI will call it the “binomial prior”. Carvalho & Scott (2009) say that this prior distribution \nis “rapidly becoming the standard,” and they use an adaptation of it in which there is a \nhierarchical prior distribution on 𝛽.  \nBornn & Caron (2011) propose a class of priors for decomposable graphs that are \ncalculated using the cliques and separators. The main one they suggest is  \nℙ(𝐺) ∝\n∏𝑎(|𝐶| −1)!\n𝐶\n∏𝑏(|𝑆| −1)!\n𝑆\n . \nThe product in the denominator is not over the collection of separators, as in section \n3.1, but over the collection of non-empty separators. (Their more general prior has \nfunctions 𝜓𝐶(𝐶𝑗) and 𝜓𝑆(𝑆𝑗) in the numerator and denominator, “with the convention \nthat 𝜓𝑆(∅) = 1,” but the rest of the paper makes it clear that 𝑆𝑗 is never ∅.) The \nparameters 𝑎 and 𝑏 can be adjusted to encourage or discourage cliques and non-empty \nseparators respectively. The main aim of these priors is to express the belief that the \nnodes should be clustered in cliques, especially non-overlapping cliques, rather than \nspread out in long lines.  \nThomas et al (2008) use undirected graphical models to analyze residue positions in \nproteins. They describe a “contact graph prior”, which only permits edges between \npairs of residue that are within a certain physical distance of each other. \nAs mentioned in section 5.4, Madigan & Raftery (1994) proposed factored priors, where \neach edge has a fixed probability of appearing in the graph and the presences of all the \nedges are independent. These can be used for both undirected graphical models and \ndirected acyclic ones. \nPriors for DAGs \nFor directed acyclic graphs, Heckerman et al (1995) assume that the user can express \ntheir prior beliefs in the form of a single graph. They assign prior probabilities to \ngraphs by penalizing them according to the number of edges that are different \ncompared to the user’s graph. Buntine (1991) describes how to convert an expert’s \n\n5 Random graph distributions \n \n 42 \nbeliefs on the probability of each edge into a prior distribution. Heckerman et al \n(1997/1999/2006) use a uniform prior.  \nMukherjee & Speed (2008) propose a more elaborate class of graph priors based on the \nproperties that the graph is believed to have. These priors are of the form  \nℙ(𝐺) ∝exp (𝜆∑𝑤𝑖𝑓𝑖(𝐺)\n𝑖\n), \nwhere each 𝑓𝑖 is a “concordance function” that increases as 𝐺 matches the prior belief \nmore closely, and the 𝑤𝑖 are weights. By using several 𝑓𝑖’s it is possible to combine \nseveral prior beliefs. They give possible 𝑓𝑖’s for several types of prior belief, for example \nthat certain edges are likely to be present or absent, that edges between two groups of \nvertices are unlikely (which they say is common in molecular biology), or that the \nnodes are unlikely to have many edges into them. They also give an 𝑓𝑖 for the belief that \nthe degree distribution is likely to be scale-free (see section 2.4). Also given are three \nreferences (19–21) that discuss informative priors for biomolecular networks.  \nChapters 4 and 5 of Byrne (2011) are about “structural Markov properties” for \ndecomposable undirected graphical models and DAG graphical models. These are \nproperties of graph distributions that are analogous to the standard Markov properties \nand the hyper and meta Markov properties from Dawid & Lauritzen (1993). The basic \nidea is that two components of the graph are conditionally independent given a \nseparating component. Graph distributions that have the structural Markov property \nare conjugate priors in certain situations.  \n5.6 \nGraph priors based on random graph models \nThis section is about what kind of prior distribution should be used for Bayesian \nlearning of graphical model structure. Of course the graph prior should encapsulate the \nresearcher’s prior beliefs about the graph structure.  \nThese beliefs for biomolecular networks were discussed in section 2.4. A good graph \nprior for biomolecular networks might give high probability to sparse graphs, \nencourage structures such as hubs and cliques, or induce an approximate power law on \nthe node degrees. The presence or absence of all of these features except cliques can be \nassessed by looking at a graph’s degree sequence. (To put it mathematically, the \npresence or absence of these features can be expressed as a function of the degree \nsequence.) For example, the question of whether there are any hubs is simply about \nwhether there are any degrees that are much higher than the others. Conversely, if you \nare free to choose the degree sequence then you can choose it so as to encourage or \ndiscourage most of these features. An alternative way to enforce sparsity is to consider \nonly forests or trees.  \nIn any case it seems sensible for the degree sequence to be the main feature of graphs \nthat is used in specifying the prior distribution, or the sole feature that is used. One \npossible random graph model is the configuration model, described in section 5.3. For \nthis, you have to specify the degree of each node. Sparsity could be enforced by simply \nchoosing low degrees, or low total degree. The configuration model might be appro-\n\n \n5.6 Graph priors based on random graph models \n \n43 \npriate if you thought that a specific node was a hub and none of the others were. But it \ncannot be used to express the belief that an unspecified node is a hub, or the belief that \neach node has a small but positive probability of being a hub.  \nUsing the configuration model leads to several complications. It generates not simple \ngraphs but configurations, which may include multiple edges and self-edges. Multiple \nedges would have to be replaced with single edges, and self-edges would have to be \ndiscarded, so the eventual degree of each node might be lower than intended. Chapters \n6–11 are about forest and tree graphical models. In the configuration model, if the \ndegrees are suitably low then the graph is likely to be a forest, so you could generate \nforests by choosing low degrees and rejecting any graphs that were not forests. \nHowever, there does not seem to be an easy and practical way to generate trees from \nthe configuration model.  \nIn connection to the configuration model the question arises of whether a given set of \nnumbers is a possible degree-sequence. For this question see Theorem 6.4 in section \n6.2.  \nPerhaps the biggest drawback of the configuration model is that, using the terminology \nfrom section 5.1, it is a random graph model rather than a graph distribution, and \ncalculating the probability of a given graph is difficult. The probability of any given \nconfiguration is 2𝐷/2(𝐷/2)!/𝐷!, where 𝐷= ∑\ndeg(𝑣)\n𝑣∈𝑉\n. But the probability of a given \ngraph is more complicated, and if you are restricting to forests or trees then it is more \ncomplicated again.  \nThe expected-degree model, also described in section 5.3, has the advantages that it is a \nfactored distribution, the probability of a given graph is easy to calculate (since for each \nedge there is a simple formula for the probability that it is present), and it is more \nflexible than the configuration model in the sense that the degree of each node is not \nspecified exactly. But it is still no use for the scenario where you believe that an \nunspecified node is a hub.  \nThe configuration model or expected-degree model could be adapted by using a \nhierarchical distribution. For example, \nℙ(𝑣 is a hub) = 𝜃 \ndeg(𝑣) | (𝑣 is a hub)~ 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝜆1) \ndeg(𝑣) | (𝑣 is not a hub) ~ 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑛(𝜆2). \nObviously 𝜆1 > 𝜆2. To generate from this model, you would choose whether each node \nis a hub according to the Bernoulli distribution with parameter 𝜃, then choose the \ndegree of each node according to the appropriate Poisson distribution, and finally \ngenerate the graph according to the configuration model or the expected-degree model. \nThis still suffers from the drawback that it is complicated and inelegant to calculate the \nprobability of a given graph, since you have to sum over all the 2𝑛 possibilities of which \nnodes are hubs and then the range of the Poisson distribution, which is the non-\nnegative integers. You could decide as a priori knowledge that there is only one hub, in \nwhich case the first sum would only have 𝑛 terms; or when exploring the graph \nposterior distribution (see section 10.1) you could have a separate “move” that consists \n\n5 Random graph distributions \n \n 44 \nof deciding anew which nodes were hubs, in other words resampling from the \n𝐵𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑙𝑖(𝜃) distribution for each node. But there are still the problems of multiple \nedges and self-edges, and the complications of restricting to forests or trees if that is \nrequired.  \nInstead of having a separate Bernoulli distribution for each node, you could have \nℙ(𝑣𝑖1, … , 𝑣𝑖𝑚 are hubs, and the other nodes are not)  \n                              = (𝑛\n𝑚)\n−1\n for all {𝑖1, … , 𝑖𝑚} ⊆{1, … , 𝑛}. \nHere 𝑚 nodes are chosen to be hubs, and these are chosen uniformly at random from all \nthe nodes. With this distribution it would be simpler to calculate the probability of a \ngiven graph, since there are only (𝑛\n𝑚) possibilities to sum over.  \nAnother alternative would be to use a Pareto distribution to choose the degrees. Pareto \ndistributions are long-tailed. Most values are small but there is some chance of getting a \nlarge value.  \n5.7 \nPractical graph prior distributions \nIn this section I propose seven criteria for a graph prior. I explain how the priors in \nsection 5.5 fail to satisfy these criteria and propose one possible prior that does fulfil \nthem. In section 11.6 I will use this prior in experiments to see whether it gives better \nresults than the uniform graph prior.  \nThe seven criteria, listed below, are intended to reflect the beliefs that the graph is \nsparse and some nodes are likely to be hubs, but it is not known which ones. They also \ninclude certain criteria that are useful in practice.  \n1. \nThere has to be an explicit formula for the probability of any given graph. This \nprobability can be unnormalized, because Bayesian structure-learning usually \nproduces unnormalized posterior probabilities anyway.  \n2. \nIt is desirable that there be a computationally efficient method for generating from \nthe prior distribution, as with random graph models. This would enable you to \ncheck whether the prior produces graphs that look right and accord with your \nbeliefs. However, this is not as important as criterion number 1.  \n3. \nThe formula should give higher probabilities to sparse graphs. The precise \nmeaning of this criterion is deliberately not specified, and it is not needed if you \nare restricting attention to trees or forests.  \n4. \nThe formula should give higher probabilities to graphs with hubs, and higher \nprobabilities to graphs with hubs that have larger degrees. The precise meaning of \nthis criterion is deliberately not specified.  \n5. \nThe formula should be a function of the unordered degree sequence, or \nequivalently the sorted degree sequence. This means the prior is symmetric in the \nnodes and the degrees are exchangeable. It corresponds to not knowing which \nnodes are hubs. The reason for this criterion is that, as mentioned in section 5.6, \nthe beliefs that the graph is sparse and some unspecified nodes are likely to be \nhubs can be expressed as beliefs about the unordered degree sequence.  \n\n \n5.7 Practical graph prior distributions \n \n45 \n6. \nIf only trees are under consideration, then it is desirable but not essential for the \nprior to be a factored distribution, because there are various fast methods for \nanalyzing factored distributions on trees.  \n7. \nAll other things being equal, the formula should be simple, because this will make \nit easier to understand and work with. \nNone of the graph prior distributions in section 5.5 satisfy these criteria fully. The size-\nbased prior of Armstrong et al (2009) and the binomial prior of Jones et al (2005) and \nothers do not fulfil criterion 4, about hubs—they would give the same probability to a \ngraph with 100 edges in which all the degrees are below 5 as to a graph with 100 edges \nin which one node had degree 50. Bornn & Caron (2011)’s general class of priors might \ninclude ones that fulfil criterion 4, but it is difficult to see how, and such priors would \nnot fulfil criterion 7. The class of priors proposed by Mukherjee & Speed (2008) \ncertainly does contain priors that fulfil criteria 1–5, but actually creating one of these \nwould be tantamount to inventing a prior from scratch, because their class of priors is \nso broad.  \nI will describe one possible graph prior distribution, which I will call the “hub-\nencouraging prior”. This has two parameters, 𝜒∈ℤ+ and 𝜓∈ℝ+. Given a graph, \nsubtract 𝜒 from all the degrees, and retain only the positive ones. The probability of the \ngraph is proportional to the sum of these values plus 𝜓. In symbols,  \nℙ(𝐺) ∝ 𝜓+ ∑max{0, deg(𝑣) −𝜒}\n𝑣∈𝑉\n  \n           =  𝜓+\n∑\n(deg(𝑣) −𝜒)\n𝑣: deg(𝑣)>𝜒\n . \nThe idea is that a node is regarded as a hub if and only if its degree is greater than 𝜒. All \ngraphs that have no hubs are equally likely, and any graph that has a hub is more likely \nthan any graph that does not. A hub contributes more if its degree is higher. How much \nhubs affect a graph’s probability also depends on 𝜓—the larger 𝜓, the smaller the effect. \nObviously 𝜒 should be a reasonably large positive integer, for example 10, and 𝜓 should \nbe positive so that even graphs with no hubs still have positive probability. The range of \nunnormalized probabilities is [𝜓, 𝜓+ 𝑝−1 −𝜒], assuming that the graphs under \nconsideration include at least one that has no hubs and at least one in which one node \nhas the maximum possible degree.  \nThis distribution is not easy to generate from, but its simplicity means that it is easy to \ninterpret and understand. For example, if 𝜓= 10 then all graphs in which no node has \ndegree greater than 10 have the same probability. If one wanted to generate graphs \nfrom this distribution and look at them, MCMC could be used to generate from it \napproximately, or a rejection or importance-sampling method could be used to sample \nfrom it exactly, though this might be cumbersome or slow.  \nAs described in chapters 7 and 8, there are numerous useful methods that can be used \nto analyze factored distributions on trees. Unfortunately, priors that fulfil criteria 4–5 \ncannot be expressed as factored distributions. Consider all the trees that contain the \nedges (𝑣2, 𝑣3), (𝑣2, 𝑣4), … , (𝑣2, 𝑣𝑛). Only one edge is unspecified, and this edge must \ninclude 𝑣1. According to criterion 4, the tree with (𝑣1, 𝑣2) ought to have higher \n\n5 Random graph distributions \n \n 46 \nprobability than the tree with (𝑣1, 𝑣3), because 𝑣2 is already a hub. So in a factored \ndistribution, 𝑤(𝑣1,𝑣2), the factor for (𝑣1, 𝑣2), would have to be higher than 𝑤(𝑣1,𝑣3), the \nfactor for (𝑣1, 𝑣3). But a similar argument about a different set of trees shows that \n𝑤(𝑣1,𝑣3) has to be higher than 𝑤(𝑣1,𝑣2), which is impossible. On the other hand, the belief \nthat a particular set of nodes are hubs can be expressed as a factored distribution—the \nweights on the edges from those nodes should simply be high.  \n \n\n \n47 \n6 \nForest and tree graphs and \ngraphical models \n6.1 \nWhy consider forest and tree graphical models? \nPreamble \nForests are graphs that have no cycles, and trees are connected forests. This definition \nof trees makes it sound as though they are bigger than forests. In graphical models this \nis appropriate, since the set of nodes is usually fixed, and so trees have more edges than \nforests (except for forests that are themselves trees). The alternative and equivalent \ndefinition of forests is that they are graphs whose connected components are all trees. \nIn the literature of machine learning, where a lot of research on graphical models \nappears, forests are sometimes referred to as trees (Meilă & Jaakkola 2006, Bradley & \nGuestrin 2010, Bach & Jordan 2003).  \nIn Bayesian learning of GGM structure, it is common to restrict attention to decom-\nposable graphs (in other words, to set the prior probability of all non-decomposable \ngraphs to zero), because the marginal likelihoods of these graphs can be calculated \nexactly using the explicit formula from section 3.1. It is also possible to restrict \nattention even further, to forests or trees, by setting the prior probability of all other \ngraphs to zero. All forests and trees are decomposable.  \nForests and trees are very restricted classes of graphs, and no doubt these graphs are \ntoo simple to be realistic models of biological or other networks, as mentioned in \nEdwards et al (2010). But there are several reasons why it might be sensible and \ndesirable to consider only forests or trees. These reasons are the subject of this chapter.  \nComputational tractability \nOne of the main reasons for restricting attention to forests or trees is that they are \nmuch more computationally tractable than general or even decomposable graphs. This \nis essentially because the joint density factorizes in terms of marginal densities on \nnodes and pairs of nodes. Viewing forests or trees as decomposable graphs, the cliques \nare the edges and the separators are the individual nodes. (In unconnected forests, the \nseparators also include the empty set, but this can be ignored because it contributes a \nfactor of 1 to the density and other quantities.) The multiplicity of each non-empty \nseparator is the degree of that node minus one. So the factorization of the joint density \nusing cliques and separators is \n\n6 Forest and tree graphs and graphical models \n \n 48 \n𝑝(𝑥) =\n∏\n𝑝(𝑥𝑢, 𝑥𝑣)\n(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸\n∏\n𝑝(𝑥𝑣)\n𝑣∈𝑉\ndeg(𝑣)−1 = ∏𝑝(𝑥𝑣)\n𝑣∈𝑉\n∏\n𝑝(𝑥𝑢, 𝑥𝑣)\n𝑝(𝑥𝑢)𝑝(𝑥𝑣)\n(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸\n , \nand the likelihood given 𝑚 independent and identically distributed observations is \n∏\n𝑝(𝑥𝑖)\n𝑚\n𝑖=1\n.  \nFor graphical-model structure-learning, the algorithm of Chow & Liu (1968), described \nin chapter 7, gives the maximum-likelihood tree in time that is polynomial in the \nnumber of nodes. Let the number of nodes be 𝑛. The time taken is 𝑂(𝑛2 log 𝑛) according \nto Acid et al (1991), Eaton & Murphy (2007), and Meyer et al (2007). But these papers \neither cite no sources for this claim or cite sources that do not make the claim. The only \npublication I have found that actually calculates the asymptotic time is Meilă (1999), \nwhich proves that it is 𝑂(𝑛2(𝑚+ log 𝑛)), where 𝑚 is the number of observations. The \nfirst term is for calculating the edge-weights, and the second term is for doing Kruskal's \nalgorithm. Goldberger & Leshem (2009) state that the time taken is 𝑂(𝑛2) if Prim’s \nalgorithm is used.  \nFor general graphs, structure-learning is believed to be computationally intractable. For \nexample, Anandkumar et al (2012) and Tan et al (2010b) both assert that structure-\nlearning of general graphs is NP-hard. However, it is not clear exactly what they mean, \nsince the maximum-likelihood graph is always the complete graph. Both papers cite \nKarger & Srebro (2001), which shows only that finding the maximum-likelihood \ndecomposable graph with bounded clique-size is NP-hard. Anandkumar et al (2012) \nalso cite Bogdanov et al (2008), which is about the case where the node-degrees are \nbounded.  \nThe other major computational task with graphical models is inference—finding the \nmarginal distributions on one set of nodes, given data on another set. This is also fast \non trees. For general graphs, inference is done using the junction-tree algorithm \n(Lauritzen & Spiegelhalter 1988), whose running time is exponential in the size of the \nlargest clique. But for trees and forests, the junction-tree algorithm simplifies to the \nsum-product algorithm, also called belief propagation, which takes time proportional to \nthe number of edges (Pearl 1988, sections 4.2–4.3).  \nSparsity \nAnother key justification for restricting attention to forests or trees is that biomolecular \nnetworks are sparse and “sparse graphs are locally tree-like”. A detailed discussion and \ninvestigation of this notion appears in section 6.2. This is the second type of sparsity \nthat arises in graphical model structure-learning (the first type of sparsity is the \nnumber of variables or nodes being much greater than the number of observations).  \nInformal justifications \nFor structure-learning of biomolecular networks, Edwards et al (2010) express the \nbelief that forests can give some idea of the structure and be useful in several ways. \nFirstly, they suggest that if you select a forest then this can be used as the initial model \nin a search algorithm through a wider space of graphs, for example decomposable \ngraphs. For algorithms that examine decomposable graphs, it is not usually possible to \nstart from graphs produced by procedures such as the graphical lasso of Friedman et al \n\n \n6.2 The claim that sparse graphs are locally tree-like \n \n49 \n(2007), since these are not guaranteed to be decomposable. A suitable forest can be \nfound quickly using the Chow–Liu algorithm, described in section 7.1.  \nEdwards et al (2010) also suggest regarding some of the properties of the selected \nforest as properties of the true graph. For example, you could assume that the true \ngraph has the same connected components as the forest—in graphical models, separate \nconnected components are marginally independent. If there is more than one \ncomponent, this will reduce the dimension of the problem, which is a great advantage \nfor computational efficiency in multivariate statistics. Edwards et al (2010) also claim \nthat analysis of forests could be used to identify hubs, which are one of the most \nimportant features of biomolecular networks.  \nTree and forest graphical models in use \nTree and forest graphical models have been used for a wide variety of applications. \nKundaje et al (2002) uses trees because they can be learnt quickly and are appro-\npriately sparse for time-series gene regulation networks. Costa et al (2008) use tree \nGGMs to model gene expression levels at different stages of cell differentiation. Each \ntree corresponds to a group of genes, each node corresponds to a known stage of cell \ndifferentiation, and the edges are directed forwards in time.  \nIhler et al (2007) gives several examples of how inference on tree graphical models can \nbe used in climate science. Willsky (2002, from page 1399) reviews how tree graphical \nmodels have been used in a very wide variety of fields including oceanography, analysis \nof network traffic, and numerous aspects of image analysis.  \nTree networks appear naturally in biology as phylogenetic trees, which show how \ndifferent species have evolved from each other. Phylogenetics uses genetic information \nto infer this tree structure. Given their evolutionary predecessors, organisms are \ngenetically independent of their predecessors’ predecessors, so these trees can be \nregarded as probabilistic graphical models, as mentioned for example in Friedman \n(2004). But phylogenetics is a major field of research in its own right, and the models \nused are more elaborate. See chapter 7 of Durbin et al (1998) for an overview of \nlearning phylogenetic trees from genetic data using clustering, bootstrapping, and other \ntechniques from statistics. Incidentally, the full evolutionary tree of life on earth is not a \ntree. Genetic material is not only passed from organisms to their offspring, but is some-\ntimes also transferred laterally, especially between bacteria. This phenomenon was first \nidentified in Freeman (1951).  \n6.2 \nThe claim that sparse graphs are locally tree-like \nPreamble \nThe notion that sparse graphs are locally tree-like is an important justification for \nstudying tree and forest graphical models. If the true graph is locally tree-like, then a \nforest structure might give useful information about small parts of the graph, even if it \nis unlikely to be accurate across large sets of nodes. Anandkumar et al (2011) state that \nsparse graphs are locally tree-like and cite Bollobás (1985), which is the first edition of \nthe book Random Graphs, about Erdős–Rényi graphs.  \n\n6 Forest and tree graphs and graphical models \n \n 50 \nSpeaking very informally, it seems believable that sparse graphs are locally tree-like, \nsince if there are not many edges then there is not much chance of them being close to \neach other and forming short cycles. One example of an informal statement on this \nquestion appears in Macris (2006), which is a physics paper. The author claims that in \nsparse graphs with 𝑛 nodes the typical size of loops is 𝑂(𝑛); rephrasing in the caption \nof a figure, he says the loops are of size 𝑂(𝑛) with high probability. There is no citation \nor comment on how this is known, and there is no formal definition of “sparse” or \n“typical”.  \nInterpretations of “sparse” \nAs discussed in section 2.4, it is often claimed that biomolecular networks are sparse, \nmeaning that they have few edges, but a precise definition of “sparse” in this context is \nelusive. It may be useful to distinguish “degree-sparsity”, where the degrees of the \nnodes are small in some sense, from “edge-sparsity”, which means only that the total \nnumber of edges is small. But obviously the degrees and the number of edges are \nclosely related. Some definitions refer to the average degree, which is 2|𝐸|/𝑛. Clearly \nsuch definitions could be expressed in terms of the total number of edges.  \nIt is possible to imagine three types of precise definition of sparse graphs. Firstly, \n“sparse” could be defined for a given graph, so that if someone gives you a graph you \ncan examine it and say whether it is sparse or not. For example, you could say that a \nsparse graph is one with at most 2𝑛 edges (𝑛 being the number of nodes). With \ngraphical models it is natural to want to say whether a specific graph is sparse, since \none deals with specific graphs that have specific numbers of nodes and edges.  \nSecondly, “sparse” could be defined for a random graph model with a fixed number of \nnodes. For example, 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑝) is sparse if 𝑝≤0.2. (For the definition of 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑝) see section \n5.2.)  \nThirdly, sparsity could be defined for a random graph model where 𝑛→∞, explicitly or \nimplicitly. This would be an asymptotic definition that only makes assertions about all \n𝑛> 𝑁, for some unspecified 𝑁, in terms of probabilities. Several definitions of this type \nappear in the literature. In Erdős–Rényi random graph theory and extremal graph \ntheory, “sparse” usually means the number of edges is 𝑂(𝑛) (Diestel 2005, page 163; \nBollobás 2001, pages 221 and 303). Bollobás & Riordan (2011) is about sparse graphs \nthat have Θ(𝑛) edges; it describes these graphs as “extremely” sparse and says they are \nthe sparsest graphs that are interesting to study. Sudakov & Verstraëte (2008) say that \ndense graphs have average degree linear in 𝑛, which means they have Θ(𝑛2) edges and \npresumably implies that sparse graphs have 𝑂(𝑛) edges. A different asymptotic \ndefinition is that sparse graphs have average degree close to 2 (Bollobás & Szemerédi \n2002).  \nThese three types of definition are separate in that none of them imply any of the others. \nThe first is about fixed graphs, the second is about fixed 𝑛, and the third is about 𝑛→∞.  \nFor pure mathematicians, the first two types of definition are rather arbitrary. It is more \nnatural to think of adjectives such as “sparse” in terms of asymptotic expressions such \nas 𝑂(𝑛), and so the third type of definition is the most common. The theory of Erdős–\nRényi random graphs mostly uses this kind of definition, and the same is true of the \n\n \n6.2 The claim that sparse graphs are locally tree-like \n \n51 \nrigorous results that have been proved about Barabási & Albert (1999)’s scale-free \ngraphs—see chapter 4 of Durrett (2007). Janson et al (2000, page 2) say that the whole \nof random graph theory is asymptotic in nature. Of course the problem with asymptotic \ndefinitions is that graphs in the real world are finite, and these definitions say nothing \nabout specific finite graphs.  \nHere are three other definitions of graph sparsity from the literature. The first two use \ndegree-sparsity. Firstly, Dobra et al (2004) say a sparse graph is one where each node \nhas only a small number of neighbours compared to the total number of nodes. This is \nconvenient for their purposes but excludes the possibility of hubs, even though the \npaper is about GGMs for gene expression networks. Secondly, Meinshausen & Bühl-\nmann (2006) use the condition that max\n𝑣∈𝑉deg(𝑣) = 𝑂(𝑛𝜅) for some 𝜅∈[0,1), for the \npurpose of proving asymptotic results. This condition means that |𝐸| =\n1\n2 ∑deg(𝑣)\n𝑣\n can \nbe as large as \n𝑛\n2 max deg(𝑣) = 𝑂(𝑛1+𝜅), so it is similar to the asymptotic definitions \nabove but less sparse than |𝐸| = 𝑂(𝑛). If 𝜅 is small, it would imply the condition of \nDobra et al (2004). Thirdly, Wille & Bühlmann (2006) state simply that “if the number \nof … edges is much smaller than 𝑝(𝑝−1)/2 [they use 𝑝 instead of 𝑛, so this is the \nmaximum possible number of edges], a graph is generally referred to as being sparse.”  \nInterpretations of “locally tree-like” \nThe phrase “locally tree-like” appears in the literatures of physics, computer science, \nand pure mathematics, as well as statistics, with a wide variety of interpretations. Many \ndefinitions of it are brief, informal, and only given in passing.  \nPerhaps the simplest interpretation of “locally tree-like” is that it means the graph has \nfew short cycles (of course this is still vague and not a formal mathematical idea). This \nis the interpretation that appears in Anandkumar et al (2011), Forney (2003), Brum-\nmitt et al (2012), and Sly (2010). With this interpretation, the claim that sparse graphs \nare locally tree-like can be justified to some extent using the theorems about Erdős–\nRényi random graphs that are described in the next section. Using these theorems will \nmean interpreting the vague words “few” and “locally” to have asymptotic meanings, as \nwith the third type of definition of “sparse” in the previous subsection.  \nOne alternative to investigating the property of having few short cycles is to investigate \nthe property of having none. This would mean investigating the girth of random graphs. \nNeither Bollobás (2001) nor Janson et al (2000), whose preface describes it as an \nupdate of Bollobás (1985), give any results about girth. But some facts can be deduced \nfrom the results on small cycles. For example, ℙ(girth ≥5) = ℙ(𝑋3 = 0 ∩𝑋4 = 0), \nwhere 𝑋𝑖 is the number of cycles of length 𝑖, and the theorems in the next subsection \ngive information about ℙ(𝑋𝑖= 0).  \nAs with “sparse”, it would be possible to make a precise definition of “locally tree-like” \nfor given graphs or given 𝑛. For example, the girth of the graph has to be at least 5, or \n𝑛/4.  \nMost of the other interpretations of “locally tree-like” refer to the girth. For example, \nMiller (2008) uses a sequence of graphs 𝐺1, 𝐺2, … and takes locally tree-like to mean \nthat 𝐺𝑚 has girth greater than 2𝑚, Coja-Oghlan et al (2009) take it to mean there are \n\n6 Forest and tree graphs and graphical models \n \n 52 \neither no short cycles or the girth is Ω(log 𝑛) (the relevant sentences are conjectures or \ninformal observations), Chandar (2010) takes it to mean the girth is Ω(log 𝑛), and \nVontobel (2003) simply says that it means there are “no short cycles”. Durrett (2007, \npage 134) says that being locally tree-like is the same thing as having no triangles—\nwhich has the practical advantage that it is completely precise and applies to actual \nspecific graphs. Karrer & Newman (2010) state that it means “all small connected \nsubsets of vertices within the network are trees.” Cooper & Frieze (2010) give a formal \ndefinition for whether a node, rather than a graph, is locally tree-like, based on whether \nany cycles appear when you explore up to a certain distance away from the node.  \nSmall cycles in Erdős–Rényi random graphs \nThe most relevant rigorous results are the set of theorems about the numbers of small \ncycles in an Erdős–Rényi random graph. For definitions of Erdős–Rényi random graphs \nand notations, see section 5.2. The present question of the number of small cycles is one \nof the many questions for which results about the two Erdős–Rényi models are very \nsimilar.  \nFollowing Bollobás (2001), the canonical text in this field, I will use the notation \n𝑎(𝑛)~𝑏(𝑛) to mean that lim\n𝑛→∞\n𝑎(𝑛)\n𝑏(𝑛) = 1 (as mentioned in Appendix III). This subsection \ndoes not present new results but rather presents and uses theorems and corollaries \nthat have been proved elsewhere.  \nTheorem 6.1 (Theorem 3a in Erdős & Rényi 1960). In 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑀), suppose that 𝑀(𝑛) ~ 𝑐𝑛, \nwhere 𝑐> 0. Let 𝑋𝑖 be the number of cycles of length 𝑖 in 𝐺. Then \nℙ(𝑋𝑖= 𝑗) ~ 𝜆𝑗𝑒−𝜆\n𝑗!\n , \nwhere 𝜆= (2𝑐)𝑖/2𝑖. In other words, 𝑋𝑖 converges in probability to Poisson(𝜆) as 𝑛→∞.  \nTheorem 6.2. With the same assumptions as in Theorem 6.1,  \nℙ(𝑋𝑖= 𝑗𝑖 for 𝑖= 3,4, … , 𝑡) ~ ∏𝜆𝑖\n𝑗𝑖𝑒−𝜆𝑖\n𝑗𝑖!\n𝑡\n𝑖=3\n \nwhere 𝜆𝑖= (2𝑐)𝑖/2𝑖. In other words, the joint distribution of the 𝑋𝑖’s converges in \nprobability to the joint distribution of independent Poisson random variables with the \ngiven means.  \nProof. This follows from Theorem 4 of Bollobás (1981), using the fact that the auto-\nmorphism group of the cycle of length 𝑖 has size 2𝑖.  \nTheorem 6.1 is about a single cycle-length. Theorem 6.2 is just Theorem 6.1 plus the \nadditional result that the numbers of different-sized cycles are asymptotically inde-\npendent.  \nTheorem 6.3 (Corollary 4.9 in Bollobás 2001, Corollary 9 in Bollobás 1985). In 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑝), \nsuppose that 𝑝(𝑛) ~ 𝑐/𝑛, where 𝑐> 0. Let 𝑋𝑖 be the number of cycles of length 𝑖 in 𝐺. \nThen \n\n \n6.2 The claim that sparse graphs are locally tree-like \n \n53 \nℙ(𝑋𝑖= 𝑗𝑖 for 𝑖= 3,4, … , 𝑡) ~ ∏𝜆𝑖\n𝑗𝑖𝑒−𝜆𝑖\n𝑗𝑖!\n𝑡\n𝑖=3\n \nwhere 𝜆𝑖= 𝑐𝑖/2𝑖.  \nObviously Theorem 6.2, about 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑀), is almost exactly the same as Theorem 6.3, \nabout 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑝). But in the former, the Poisson parameters have a factor of 2 that does not \nappear in the latter. This is to be expected, since in 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑀) with 𝑀(𝑛) ~ 𝑐𝑛 the \nexpected number of edges is asymptotically 𝑐𝑛, whereas in 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑝) with 𝑝(𝑛) ~ 𝑐/𝑛 the \nexpected number of edges is 𝑐(𝑛−1)/2, or equivalently 𝑐𝑛/2; and the two models \ncorrespond most closely when the expected numbers of edges are the same.  \nThe main results in Bollobás (1981) and section 4.1 of Bollobás (2001) are more \ngeneral than the ones given above. They state that if a possible subgraph is “strictly \nbalanced”, then the number of copies of it that appear in a random graph is asym-\nptotically distributed as a Poisson random variable. “Strictly balanced” is a property \npossessed by all cycles, and “copies” of a subgraph means subgraphs that are iso-\nmorphic to it.  \nThe values of the Poisson parameters for Erdős–Rényi graphs \nThe above results on Erdős–Rényi random graphs use the assumption that 𝑀(𝑛) ~ 𝑐𝑛 \nor 𝑝(𝑛) ~ 𝑐/𝑛. The number of possible edges is ~𝑛2/2. So both the assumptions imply \nthat the graph is sparse in the sense that the number of edges is 𝑂(𝑛)—as discussed \nabove, this is the meaning of “sparse” that is most often used in graph theory. For fixed 𝑐 \nand any given 𝑖, the Poisson parameters do not depend on 𝑛. This means that for large 𝑛 \nthey are “small”, in the sense that as 𝑛→∞ the proportion of cycles of length 𝑖 that \nappear in the graph will tend to zero. (This proportion is the number of cycles of length \n𝑖 that appear in the graph divided by the number of cycles of length 𝑖 in 𝐾𝑛.) In this \nsense the results imply that for large 𝑛 sparse graphs have few short cycles—in other \nwords, they are locally tree-like.  \nA secondary question is whether short cycles are commoner or rarer than long ones. In \nTheorem 6.2, 𝜆𝑖= (2𝑐)𝑖/2𝑖. For large 𝑖 this is dominated by (2𝑐)𝑖. If 𝑐> 0.5, then long \ncycles are more likely than short ones, but if 𝑐≤0.5, then short cycles are more likely \nthan long ones. However, the latter case corresponds to extremely sparse graphs where \n|𝐸| ≤|𝑉|/2 (at least asymptotically). These have so few edges that long cycles are not \neven possible. In Theorem 6.3, 𝜆𝑖= 𝑐𝑖/2𝑖, so the situation is essentially the same but \nthe boundary between the two cases is 𝑐= 1.  \nThe next question is whether the Poisson parameters 𝜆𝑖 are actually reasonably small \nfor sparse graphs with realistic 𝑛. The obvious way to investigate this is to choose 𝑛, \nand 𝑝 or 𝑀, and find 𝜆𝑖 using the equations given above. If 𝜆𝑖 is small for, say, 𝑖∈\n{3,4,5,6}, then it can be said that the graph is locally tree-like. Table 6.1 shows the \nvalues of the Poisson parameters for small 𝑖 with a sparse model from 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑝), a sparse \nmodel from 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑀), and the random graph model 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑝= 0.5), where all graphs are \nequally likely. Of course the Poisson parameters are also the asymptotic mean numbers \nof cycles.  \n\n6 Forest and tree graphs and graphical models \n \n 54 \nThe first two random graph models have the same Poisson parameters. But the \nparameters for 𝐺(100,0.5) are much bigger. Based on this it seems reasonable to state \nthat for the sparse random graph models the Poisson parameters are small.  \n \nRandom graph  \nmodel \nPoisson parameters for numbers of cycles of lengths from 3 to 8 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n𝐺(𝑛, 𝑝) with 𝑝= 10/𝑛 \nExample: 𝐺(100,0.1) \n167 \n1 250 \n10 000 \n83 333 \n714 286 \n6 250 000 \n𝐺(𝑛, 𝑀) with 𝑀= 5𝑛 \nExample: 𝐺(100,500) \n167 \n1 250 \n10 000 \n83 333 \n714 286 \n6 250 000 \n𝐺(100, 𝑝= 0.5)  \n20 833 \n781 250 \n3.1 × 107 \n1.3 × 109 5.6 × 1010 2.4 × 1012 \nTable 6.1. Poisson parameters for the numbers of cycles for two sets of sparse Erdős–Rényi \nrandom graph models and for 𝐺(100,0.5). These are from Theorems 6.2 and 6.3. (In 𝐺(100,0.1), \n𝐺(100,500), and 𝐺(100,0.5), the parameter 𝑐, defined in Theorems 6.2 and 6.3, was chosen so \nthat the asymptotic conditions were satisfied exactly; so for 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑝) it was chosen to be 𝑛𝑝, and \nfor 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑀) it was chosen to be 𝑀/𝑛.)  \n \nUsing simple Monte Carlo to approximate the numbers of small cycles \nThere is often a tacit assumption that asymptotic results will be approximately true for \nrealistic-sized problems. But graphical models usually have fixed 𝑛, and for any fixed 𝑛 \nit is quite possible that a given asymptotic result does not hold, even approximately.  \nThe obvious avenue of approach is to look at actual random graphs, identify all their \ncycles, and examine the numbers of cycles of each length. For very small 𝑛 it would be \npossible to generate all the possible graphs for either of the Erdős–Rényi random graph \nmodels. For 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑝), this would involve generating all 2(𝑛\n2) possible graphs and \nweighting them according to their probabilities. This is only feasible for 𝑛 up to about 8. \nFor 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑀), it would only be necessary to generate the ((𝑛\n2)\n𝑀) graphs that are possible \nunder this model, but even for 𝑛= 16 and 𝑀= 10 this is 1.2 × 1014, which is very large. \nSo it seems more sensible to look at a sample of randomly generated graphs from \n𝐺(𝑛, 𝑝) or 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑀). This is a type of simple Monte Carlo method. If the sample is \nreasonably big then the empirical distributions of the numbers of cycles should be \nsimilar to the true distributions.  \nIdentifying all the cycles in a given undirected graph can be done by considering all the \npossible cycles and then checking if they are present. Coming up with a more efficient \nmethod is far from trivial. Much research on this problem appeared in the late 1960s \nand early 1970s. Mateti & Deo (1976) give a summary of all the algorithms that were \nknown at that time, classified into four basic types. The simplest way I have found is to \nuse the algorithm in Paton (1969) to find a “fundamental set” of cycles, which is a basis \nof the vector space of all the cycles, and then use the algorithm in Gibbs (1969) to \ngenerate the other cycles. I have not found any single document that gives a complete \naccount of how to find all the cycles in an undirected graph.  \n\n \n6.2 The claim that sparse graphs are locally tree-like \n \n55 \nI wrote a program to generate a simple Monte Carlo sample of random graphs from \n𝐺(𝑛, 𝑝) or 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑀) and then count all their cycles. Some results are shown in Figure 6.1. \nThe most relevant cycles are the shortest ones, and the bar-charts show that there are \nindeed few of these. The asymptotic means are close to the true values for the very \nshortest cycles.  \nSmall cycles in graphs with given degree sequences \nAs discussed above, claims that sparse graphs are locally tree-like have usually been \nmade with reference to theorems about cycles in Erdős–Rényi random graphs, or with \nreference to nothing. But, as discussed in section 2.4, Barabási & Oltvai (2004) and \nother papers have claimed that real networks tend to be “scale-free”, meaning that over \na large range the degrees of the nodes follow a power law. This would mean that the \nErdős–Rényi random graph models are not appropriate. It might be more sensible to \nconsider theorems about random graph models that are scale-free or approximately so.  \nThe most relevant results seem to be the ones about cycles in random graphs with given \ndegree sequence. This subsection will present the results but not a detailed investi-\ngation. A degree sequence is a list of 𝑛 non-negative integers. For a graph to have a \ngiven degree sequence means that the degrees of its nodes are the same as the integers \nin this list, in some order. The random graph model is that all graphs with the given \ndegree sequence are equally likely. Random graphs with given degree sequence could \nbe made scale-free by choosing the degree sequence to follow a power law.  \nThe other main feature of biomolecular networks mentioned in section 2.4 was that \nthey contain hubs. Small cycles in graphs that contain hubs could be investigated using \nthe theorems on random graphs with given degree sequence. The degree sequence \nshould simply be chosen to contain a small number of large degrees.  \nIn either case it is necessary to specify a degree sequence. Given a degree sequence, the \ntheorems below can be used to calculate the asymptotic numbers of short cycles. But \nnot just any sequence of integers can be a degree sequence. For a start, they have to be \nin {0, … , 𝑛−1} and their sum has to be even. But this is not sufficient—for example, \n{2,2,0} is not the degree sequence of any graph. Necessary and sufficient conditions are \ngiven by Theorem 6.4.  \nTheorem 6.4 (Erdős & Gallai 1960). Let {𝑑1, … , 𝑑𝑛} be a non-increasing sequence of \nnon-negative integers. This is the degree sequence of some graph if and only if ∑\n𝑑𝑖\n𝑛\n𝑖=1\n is \neven and ∑\n𝑑𝑖\n𝑘\n𝑖=1\n≤𝑘(𝑘−1) + ∑\nmin{𝑘, 𝑑𝑖}\n𝑛\n𝑖=𝑘+1\n for 1 ≤𝑘≤𝑛.  \nProof. For a proof in English see Tripathi et al (2010).  \nTheorem 6.5 gives the asymptotic distributions of the numbers of cycles.  \nTheorem 6.5 (Theorem 2 in Bollobás 1980). Let {𝑑1, … , 𝑑𝑛} be a given degree sequence, \nand suppose all graphs with this degree sequence are equally likely. Let 𝑚= ½ ∑\n𝑑𝑖\n𝑛\n𝑖=1\n \nbe the number of edges in each of these graphs, and assume that 2𝑚−𝑛→∞ as 𝑛→∞. \nThen the numbers of cycles 𝑋3, … , 𝑋𝑘 are asymptotically independent Poisson random \nvariables with means 𝜆𝑖= 𝜆𝑖/2𝑖, where 𝜆=\n1\n𝑚∑\n(𝑑𝑖\n2 )\n𝑛\n𝑖=1\n.  \n \n\n6 Forest and tree graphs and graphical models \n \n 56 \n(a) 𝐺(22,0.1) \n \n(b) 𝐺(30,40) \n \nFigure 6.1. Numbers of cycles in (a) 𝐺(22,0.1) and (b) 𝐺(30,40). The “actual” means were found \nby generating simple Monte Carlo samples of 5000 graphs and then counting all the cycles. In \n(a) the asymptotic means are the Poisson parameters from Theorem 6.3, with 𝑐= 𝑛𝑝; in (b) \nthey are the Poisson parameters from Theorem 6.2, with 𝑐= 𝑀/𝑛. The asymptotic means are \nonly shown for short cycles, since they get very big, and in (b) the largest cycle-lengths are \nomitted altogether.  \n \n\n \n6.2 The claim that sparse graphs are locally tree-like \n \n57 \nWhether these Poisson parameters can be regarded as small depends on the degree \nsequence, or more accurately the sequence of degree sequences, since the theorem is \nabout asymptotic behaviour as 𝑛→∞. (Theorem 6.5 was also proved independently as \nCorollary 1 in Wormald 1981. Wormald’s result is slightly different, being about cycles \nof an arbitrary set of lengths.)  \nA special case of graphs with given degree sequences is regular graphs. Regular graphs \nare ones where every node has the same degree, and 𝑑-regular graphs are ones where \nevery node has degree 𝑑. All 𝑑-regular graphs have 𝑛𝑑/2 edges, so if 𝑑 is fixed they are \nsparse in the sense that the number of edges is 𝑂(𝑛). Many of the results on regular \ngraphs assume that 𝑑≥3. This is not a restrictive assumption, since if 𝑑= 2 then the \ngraph is one big loop, and if 𝑑= 1 then it consists of nothing but connected components \nof size 2—these cases are both trivial.  \nRegular graphs definitely do not have hubs, so they are not likely to be good models for \nbiomolecular networks. In any case, for regular graphs Theorem 6.5 simplifies to give \nthe following result.  \nTheorem 6.6. (Wormald 1981; Bollobás 1980; Bollobás 2001, page 56). Assume graphs \nare chosen uniformly at random from the set of 𝑑-regular graphs. For fixed 𝑘≥3, the \nnumbers of cycles 𝑋3, … , 𝑋𝑘 are asymptotically independent Poisson random variables \nwith means 𝜆3, … 𝜆𝑘, where 𝜆𝑖= (𝑑−1)𝑖/2𝑖. \nAs with Theorems 6.2 and 6.3, about Erdős–Rényi graphs, these Poisson parameters do \nnot depend on 𝑛, so as 𝑛→∞ the proportion of cycles of length 𝑖 that appear in the \ngraph tends to zero. In this sense the graphs have few short cycles and are locally tree-\nlike.  \nBollobás (2001, page 84) comments as follows on the similarity between this result for \nregular graphs and the results for Erdős–Rényi random graphs. A random 𝑑-regular \ngraph is in many ways similar to either 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑝) with 𝑝(𝑛) = 𝑑/𝑛 or 𝐺(𝑛, 𝑀) with \n𝑀(𝑛) = 𝑑𝑛/2. In a random 𝑑-regular graph the expected number of cycles of length 𝑖 is \n(𝑑−1)𝑖/2𝑖, but in the two Erdős–Rényi models it is 𝑑𝑖/2𝑖. This means that short cycles \nare slightly less likely in regular graphs than in Erdős–Rényi random graphs.  \nSlightly stronger than Theorem 6.6 is Theorem 6.7, in which 𝑑 is allowed to grow slowly \nas a function of 𝑛.  \nTheorem 6.7 (Theorem 1 in McKay et al 2004). Assume graphs are chosen uniformly at \nrandom from the set of 𝑑-regular graphs. Allow 𝑑= 𝑑(𝑛) and 𝑔= 𝑔(𝑛) to increase with \n𝑛, so long as (𝑑−1)2𝑔−1 = 𝑜(𝑛). Let {𝑐1, … , 𝑐𝑘} be a set of cycle-lengths that is a non-\nempty subset of {3, … , 𝑔}. Then 𝑋𝑐1, … , 𝑋𝑐𝑘, the numbers of cycles of these lengths, are \nasymptotically independent Poisson random variables with means 𝜆𝑖= (𝑑−1)𝑐𝑖/2𝑐𝑖.  \nCorollary 6.8 (Corollary 1 in McKay et al 2004). With the same assumptions as in \nTheorem 6.7, the probability that the girth is greater than 𝑔 is  \nexp (−∑(𝑑−1)𝑟/2𝑟\n𝑔\n𝑟=3\n+ 𝑜(1)) . \n\n6 Forest and tree graphs and graphical models \n \n 58 \nIf the restriction to the class of regular graphs is lifted, and instead 𝑑 is the maximum \ndegree of the graph, then it might be possible to use one of the above results on \nasymptotic Poisson distributions as a sort of “upper bound” and thus show that a \nfurther class of sparse graphs is locally tree-like. Removing edges from a regular graph \ncan only decrease the number of cycles of any given length.  \nSummary \nThe purpose of this section was to consider the notion that sparse graphs are locally \ntree-like. Probably the most natural way to interpret “sparse” is asymptotically (with \n𝑛→∞), and probably the most natural way to interpret “locally tree-like” is that there \nare few short cycles, where “few” and “short” are also to be interpreted asymptotically. \nWhen these interpretations are used, theorems about the two Erdős–Rényi random \ngraph models can be used to justify the notion that sparse graphs are locally tree-like.  \nThe first drawback of this is that asymptotic theorems say nothing about real graphs \nwith fixed 𝑛. The only remedies are to generate actual graphs and count the cycles, as I \ndid above, or to come up with new theorems about the numbers of short cycles in \ngraphs with specific 𝑛.  \nThe second drawback is that, as mentioned in section 2.4 and 5.3, real networks are not \nwell modelled by Erdős–Rényi graphs. For scale-free graphs or other complex networks \nit may be possible to use the theorems about cycles in graphs with given degree \nsequence, though some of these random graphs are not defined as precisely as Erdős–\nRényi graphs.  \nSupplementary notes: extremal graph theory \nThe field of extremal graph theory (Bollobás 1978, Diestel 2005) addresses problems \nthat are somewhat related to the question of being locally tree-like. Extremal graph \ntheory is about “all graphs” or “no graphs”; it is not concerned with “most graphs” or \nrandom graphs. The archetypal question is to find the number of edges, as a function of \nthe number of nodes, such that all graphs with that many edges contain a certain \nsubgraph. The biggest graphs that do not contain the subgraph are called the extremal \ngraphs. For example, Turán (1941) found the graph that has the maximum number of \nedges among graphs with 𝑛 nodes that do not contain any copies of 𝐾𝑟. This graph, \nknown as the Turán graph, is the extremal graph for this problem.  \nExtremal graph theory is not just about subgraphs but also about other properties. The \nmost relevant property to the question of being locally tree-like is girth. As mentioned \nabove, “locally tree-like” could be taken to mean that a graph has large girth. Bollobás & \nSzemerédi (2002) show that the girth of a graph with 𝑛 nodes and 𝑛+ 𝑘 edges is at \nmost 2(𝑛+ 𝑘)(log𝑘+ log log 𝑘+ 4)/3𝑘, for 𝑛≥4 and 𝑘≥2. Section III.1 of Bollobás \n(1978) is about graphs with large minimal degree and large girth.  \nSudakov & Verstraëte (2008) prove various results about the set of lengths of cycles in a \ngraph. For example, given the average degree and the girth of the graph, they give an \nasymptotic lower bound for the size of this set and show that it contains a certain \nnumber of consecutive even integers.  \n \n\n \n59 \n7 \nThe Chow–Liu algorithm  \n7.1 \nFinding the optimal tree \nSuppose you are given a joint distribution on a set of discrete-valued random variables, \nand each variable corresponds to a node. From the distributions on these variables that \nare Markov with respect to a tree on these nodes, you have to find one that is closest to \nthe given distribution in terms of Kullback–Leibler distance. An elegant algorithm for \nsolving this problem was given in Chow & Liu (1968), a much-cited paper that \nappeared before probabilistic graphical models were widely studied.  \nThe paper also addressed a dual problem. Suppose the true distribution on the \ndiscrete-valued random variables is unknown but observations from it are available. \nFrom the distributions that are Markov with respect to a tree, find one that has \nmaximum likelihood. The algorithm for doing this is essentially the same as the one for \nthe first problem, except that it uses empirical distributions rather than true ones.  \nThe algorithm for the second problem is described below. For both problems it is \npossible for there to be more than one optimal tree, but I will sometimes refer to “the” \noptimal tree as this is easier to read.  \nChow & Liu describe their algorithms using directed graphical models in the shape of \nrooted trees. Each of their arrows points from a dependent variable to the variable it \ndepends on, and towards the root—the opposite direction to what is now standard. Any \nrooted-tree DAG is Markov-equivalent to an undirected tree, so the algorithms and \nresults can also be stated using undirected graphs.  \nGiven observations from a discrete-valued multivariate distribution, the obvious way of \nfinding the optimal tree and distribution would be to first find the optimal distribution \nfor each possible tree, and then look through all the trees and find the optimal one. It \nturns out that these two steps can be done in one. Let the nodes be {1, … , 𝑝}, and \nwithout loss of generality let node 1 be the root of the tree. Chow & Liu write the \ndensity as  \n𝑝(𝑥) = 𝑝(𝑥1) ∏𝑝( 𝑥𝑖∣∣𝑥𝑝𝑎(𝑖) )\n𝑝\n𝑖=2\n, \nwhere 𝑝𝑎(𝑖) is the parent of node 𝑖 (they would draw the arrow from 𝑖 to 𝑝𝑎(𝑖)). If \nthere are 𝑛 independent and identically distributed data, the likelihood is ∏\n𝑝(𝑥𝑘)\n𝑛\n𝑘=1\n. \nChow & Liu (1968) show that maximizing the log-likelihood over all tree distributions \nis equivalent to maximizing  \n\n7 The Chow–Liu algorithm \n \n 60 \n∑\n𝐼𝑢,𝑣\n(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸\n , \nwhere (𝑢, 𝑣) is an unordered pair and 𝐼𝑢,𝑣 is the empirical mutual information, also \ncalled the sample mutual information (Chow & Liu 1968) or the empirical cross-\nentropy (Lauritzen 2006): \n𝐼𝑢,𝑣= ∑𝑛(𝑥𝑢, 𝑥𝑣)\n𝑛\n log\n𝑛(𝑥𝑢, 𝑥𝑣)/𝑛\n𝑛(𝑥𝑢)𝑛(𝑥𝑣)/𝑛2 \n𝑥𝑢, 𝑥𝑣\n. \nHere for example 𝑛(𝑥𝑢, 𝑥𝑣) is the number of observations of 𝑋𝑢= 𝑥𝑢 and 𝑋𝑣= 𝑥𝑣, and if \nany of the 𝑛(⋅)’s is zero then the summand is taken to be zero. Recall that the variables \nare all discrete. 𝐼𝑢,𝑣 is always non-negative.  \nAs an aside, note that the elements in the expression for 𝐼𝑢,𝑣 are maximum-likelihood \nestimators. For example, 𝑛(𝑥𝑢, 𝑥𝑣)/𝑛 is the MLE of ℙ(𝑋𝑢= 𝑥𝑢, 𝑋𝑣= 𝑥𝑣). This is just the \nobservation that in discrete decomposable graphical models the MLE of each \nprobability on a clique is simply the observed proportion of the data that take that set \nof values.  \nThe first part of the Chow–Liu algorithm is to calculate 𝐼𝑢,𝑣 for all possible edges (𝑢, 𝑣). \nIn the second part of the algorithm, the 𝐼𝑢,𝑣’s are regarded as weights on the possible \nedges. The task that remains is to find the tree with maximum total weight. This is a \nmaximum-weight spanning tree (MWST) problem. In this case what is sought is a \nmaximum-weight tree that spans the complete graph 𝐾𝑝.  \nThere are several simple algorithms that can solve MWST problems in polynomial time \nand are thus efficient in high dimensions. Chow & Liu (1968) and most papers based on \nit use Kruskal’s algorithm (Kruskal 1956), which is described in the next section. For \nanother discussion of the Chow–Liu algorithm see Pearl (1988, section 8.2.1). The \nasymptotic time that the algorithm takes is discussed in section 6.1.  \n7.2 \nKruskal’s algorithm \nThe algorithm as used in the Chow–Liu algorithm \nGiven a complete graph on a set of nodes, and real-valued weights on each edge, the \nfollowing algorithm produces a maximum-weight spanning tree—in other words, a \nmaximum-weight tree on the same set of nodes.  \n \nAlgorithm IV: Kruskal’s algorithm \n1. Start with the empty graph on the given set of 𝑝 nodes.  \n2. From among the unused edges whose addition would not lead to the appearance of a \ncycle, add the one with largest weight. (If there are two or more such edges, add any \none of them.)  \n3. Repeat step 2 until you have 𝑝−1 edges.  \n \n\n \n7.3 Relevant developments since Chow–Liu \n \n61 \nDifferent versions of the algorithm \nAlgorithm IV gives a maximum-weight spanning tree for the complete graph. Kruskal’s \nalgorithm is usually stated in a different form, for finding the minimum-weight \nspanning tree for a given connected graph (Kruskal 1956). Bondy & Murty (2008) say \nthat Kruskal’s algorithm first appeared in Borůvka (1926a,b), which are in Czech, and \nthat Kruskal’s discovery of it was independent.  \nWhether the total weight has to be minimized or maximized is obviously trivial. To \nminimize instead of maximize, simply replace “largest” with “smallest” in step 2.  \nMoreover, as pointed out by Kruskal (1956), there is no loss of generality in considering \nonly the complete graph. Suppose you want to find a maximum-weight spanning tree \nfor a connected graph 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸) that is not complete. In the complete graph 𝐾|𝑉|, set \nthe weight of each edge 𝑒 to be its weight in 𝐺 if 𝑒∈𝐸, or −∞ if 𝑒∉𝐸, and do Algorithm \nIV. 𝐺 spans 𝐾|𝑉| and thus contains at least one spanning tree. This means that 𝐾|𝑉| has at \nleast one spanning tree with no infinite-weight edges. It follows that the algorithm will \nnever add an infinite-weight edge and will produce a tree that spans 𝐺. Any proof of \ncorrectness for Algorithm IV will therefore also suffice as a proof of correctness for the \nmore usual form of Kruskal’s algorithm, and vice versa.  \nThe most well-known alternative to Kruskal’s algorithm is Prim’s algorithm, for which a \nfull proof appears in section 2.2 of Even (1979).  \nProofs \nProofs that the usual form of Kruskal’s algorithm is correct can be found in Bondy & \nMurty (1976, page 39) or Aldous & Wilson (2000, pages 190–191). Kruskal (1956) \nonly proved that the algorithm is correct when the weights are all distinct. All these \nproofs use the same basic idea of identifying a cycle and then modifying a tree by \nadding an edge and removing one—see also Theorem 2.3 in Even (1979). They use \nProposition 2.1, which stated that adding an edge to a tree creates a graph with \nprecisely one cycle.  \nKruskal (1956) proved that if all the edge-weights are distinct then the minimum-\nweight spanning tree is unique. (Actually this was the main purpose of the paper; the \nalgorithm was merely a way to prove this fact.) If the edge-weights are not distinct, then \nthe minimum- or maximum-weight spanning tree is not necessarily unique.  \n7.3 \nRelevant developments since Chow–Liu  \nChow & Liu’s method can be adapted to the case of the multivariate Gaussian distri-\nbution. Again it gives either the tree that minimizes the Kullback–Leibler distance to the \ntrue distribution or the maximum-likelihood tree. As in the discrete case, the weight on \neach edge is the mutual information. This equals −\n1\n2 log(1 −𝜌𝑒2), where 𝜌𝑒 is the actual \nor empirical correlation coefficient along edge 𝑒. Transforming the edge-weights by any \nmonotone-increasing function gives the same result in Kruskal’s algorithm, so it is also \npossible to use just 𝜌𝑒2 (Goldberger & Leshem 2009). This method for GGMs appears in \nLauritzen (2006), Goldberger & Leshem (2009), and Tan et al (2010a).  \n\n7 The Chow–Liu algorithm \n \n 62 \nEdwards et al (2010) gives two adaptations of Chow & Liu’s method. The first deals \nwith the drawback that even if the true graph is a forest, Chow & Liu’s method will \nalways produce a tree. This is analogous to the facts that in graphical models the \nmaximum-likelihood graph is always the complete graph and in regression problems \nthe maximum-likelihood model always includes all the covariates. They adapt Chow & \nLiu’s method to optimize a penalized likelihood criterion such as AIC or BIC. In general, \nthis produces a forest, not a tree. The formula for the edge-weights is changed by \nsubtracting a certain quantity. This means that the edge-weights can be negative. To \nfind the optimal forest, you remove all the edges whose weights are negative and then \ndo Kruskal’s algorithm on all the connected components. Their second adaptation is an \nextension to mixed graphical models where some nodes are discrete and some are \nGaussian. Obviously GGMs are a special case of these models. The paper also includes \nseveral example applications of the methods. One of these uses the breast cancer data \nfrom the R package “gRbase”. The analysis took 18 seconds and located several nodes \nthat seem to be hubs. It is also described in section 7.3 of Højsgaard et al (2012). \nThe two algorithms in Edwards et al (2010) have been implemented in the R function \nminForest, in the package “gRapHD” (Abreu et al 2010). See “Finding the MAP forest in \nR” in section 7.4.  \n7.4 \nFinding the MAP forest \nUsing a uniform graph prior  \nIn Bayesian structure-learning, the graph that has highest posterior probability is called \nthe MAP (maximum a posteriori probability) graph. An adaptation of the Chow–Liu \nalgorithm can be used to find the MAP forest for discrete random variables, assuming \nthat the graph prior is uniform on the set of forests (Højsgaard et al 2012, section 7.7). \nThe weight of each edge is taken to be the logarithm of the Bayes factor for the presence \nof that edge, and the version of Kruskal’s algorithm in Edwards et al (2010) is then used \nto find the MAP forest. (Remove the edges that have negative weights, then do Kruskal’s \nalgorithm on the graph that remains.) Forests like this are sometimes called spanning \nforests, where “spanning” just means that the forest has the same set of nodes as the \noriginal graph.  \nThis method can be adapted to GGM structure-learning with the hyper inverse Wishart \nprior on the covariance matrix. This adaptation appears in lectures 8 and 9 of Lauritzen \n(2006). Let 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸) and 𝑝= |𝑉|. Assume the graph prior distribution is uniform, so \n𝑝(𝐺) is the same for every graph and 𝑝( 𝐺∣𝑥) ∝𝑝(𝑥∣𝐺). The method is best explained \nby rearranging the formula for the marginal likelihood 𝑝(𝑥∣𝐺). In section 3.1 I wrote \nthe formula for the marginal likelihood of a decomposable graph as  \n𝑝( 𝑥∣𝐺) = (2𝜋)−𝑛𝑝/2\n∏\n𝑘(𝐶, 𝛿, 𝐷)\n𝑘(𝐶, 𝛿+ 𝑛, 𝐷+ 𝑈) \n𝐶\n∏\n𝑘(𝑆, 𝛿, 𝐷)\n𝑘(𝑆, 𝛿+ 𝑛, 𝐷+ 𝑈)\n𝑆\n \n , \nwhere  \n\n \n7.4 Finding the MAP forest \n \n63 \n𝑘(𝐶, 𝛿, 𝐷) =\n|𝐷𝐶\n2 |\n𝛿+|𝐶|−1\n2\n Γ|𝐶| (𝛿+ |𝐶| −1\n2\n)\n . \nIn the decomposition of a forest the cliques are the edges (strictly, the pairs of nodes \nthat have edges between them) and the isolated nodes (the nodes that have degree \nzero). The separators are a subset of the individual nodes plus, if the forest is not \nconnected, the empty set. The number of times each node appears as a separator is its \ndegree minus one; any empty separators contribute a factor of 1 and can thus be \nignored.  \nSo for forests the marginal likelihood is  \n𝑝( 𝑥∣𝐺) = (2𝜋)−𝑛𝑝/2\n∏\n𝑘({𝑢, 𝑣}, 𝛿, 𝐷)\n𝑘({𝑢, 𝑣}, 𝛿+ 𝑛, 𝐷+ 𝑈) \n(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸\n∏\n[\n𝑘({𝑣}, 𝛿, 𝐷)\n𝑘({𝑣}, 𝛿+ 𝑛, 𝐷+ 𝑈)]\ndeg(𝑣)−1\n𝑣∈𝑉\n \n . \nLet \n𝐾(𝑣1, 𝑣2, … , 𝑣𝑚) = \n𝑘({𝑣1, 𝑣2, … , 𝑣𝑚}, 𝛿, 𝐷)\n𝑘({𝑣1, 𝑣2, … , 𝑣𝑚}, 𝛿+ 𝑛, 𝐷+ 𝑈) . \n(𝐾 is a “variadic” function that takes any number of arguments.) Then  \n𝑝( 𝑥∣𝐺) = (2𝜋)−𝑛𝑝/2 ∏\n𝐾(𝑢, 𝑣) \n(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸\n∏\n𝐾(𝑣)deg(𝑣)−1\n𝑣∈𝑉\n   \n                                   = (2𝜋)−𝑛𝑝/2 ∏𝐾(𝑣) \n𝑣∈𝑉\n∏\n𝐾(𝑢, 𝑣)\n𝐾(𝑢)𝐾(𝑣) .\n(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸\n \nIn this last expression, the first product is over the nodes, which are the same for all \ngraphs. So to choose among forests with different edges it is sufficient to maximize the \nsecond product. This can be done using an adaptation of Chow & Liu’s algorithm. \nSimply let the weight of edge (𝑢, 𝑣) be log\n𝐾(𝑢,𝑣)\n𝐾(𝑢)𝐾(𝑣) , and as in Edwards et al (2010) omit \nall edges that have negative weights.  \nAfter describing how to use penalized likelihoods with the Chow–Liu algorithm, \nEdwards et al (2010) states that Panayidou (2011) “finds the Bayesian MAP tree/forest \nin a similar way”. This probably refers to the method in Højsgaard et al (2012) or the \nmethod I have described. (Panayidou 2011 can only be viewed by travelling to Oxford.)  \nThis method for finding the MAP forest is fast, like the standard Chow–Liu algorithm. \nSimilar methods appear in Meilă-Predoviciu (1999, page 59) and Heckerman et al \n(1995, pages 226–227). Lauritzen (2006) poses the question of whether there a \nfeasible algorithm for finding the MAP decomposable graph, and states that the answer \nis probably no since this task is probably NP-complete.  \n\n7 The Chow–Liu algorithm \n \n 64 \nFactored priors \nThe method described in the previous section requires the graph prior distribution to \nbe uniform, so that 𝑝( 𝐺∣𝑥) ∝𝑝(𝑥∣𝐺). But it can also be adapted to work with \nfactored distributions, which were defined in section 5.4. For factored distributions, \neach edge (𝑢, 𝑣) has associated with it a quantity 𝑤𝑢𝑣, and the probability of 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸) \nis  \n𝑝(𝐺) ∝\n∏𝑤𝑢𝑣\n(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸\n . \nWith a graph prior distribution of this form, the posterior probability of graph 𝐺 is  \n𝑝( 𝐺∣𝑥) ∝𝑝( 𝑥∣𝐺)𝑝(𝐺) \n= (2𝜋)−𝑛𝑝/2 ∏𝐾(𝑣) \n𝑣∈𝑉\n∏\n𝐾(𝑢, 𝑣)\n𝐾(𝑢)𝐾(𝑣) \n(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸\n ∏𝑤𝑢𝑣 \n(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸\n. \nThe only parts of this formula that depend on the forest are the second and third \nproducts. So the weight of edge (𝑢, 𝑣) should be set to  \nlog ( 𝐾(𝑢, 𝑣)\n𝐾(𝑢)𝐾(𝑣) 𝑤𝑢𝑣) .  \nKruskal’s algorithm can now be used as before to find the MAP forest. Edges whose \nweights are negative should be removed before doing Kruskal’s algorithm.  \nThis method cannot be adapted to work with general graph prior distributions. In the \ngeneral case the posterior probability of a graph 𝐺 is 𝑝( 𝐺∣𝑥) ∝𝑝( 𝑥∣𝐺)𝑝(𝐺), and the \nprior probability of the graph, 𝑝(𝐺), cannot be factorized into a contribution from each \nedge. So it is impossible to write 𝑝( 𝐺∣𝑥) in a way that reduces the problem to that of \nfinding a maximum-weight spanning forest. For example, with the size-based priors of \nArmstrong et al (2009), adding an edge does not have a fixed multiplicative effect on \nthe probability of the graph; the effect depends rather on how many edges there are in \ntotal.  \nFinding the MAP forest in R \nThe MAP forest for GGMs can be found using the function minForest, from the R \npackage “gRapHD” (Abreu et al 2010; see also Edwards et al 2010 or Højsgaard et al \n2012, section 7.4). You have to write a custom function to calculate the edge-weights \nand then pass this function to minForest as the “stat” argument. The only other \narguments you need to provide are the data (an 𝑛× 𝑝 matrix) and the prior values of \nthe two HIW hyperparameters. I tested this method on the iris data used by Roverato \n(2002) and it gave the right answer.  \nDespite its name, minForest finds the forest that maximizes the given edge-weights. In \nits documentation the Arguments section states that the default value of stat is “LR”, but \nactually it is “BIC”.  \n\n \n7.5 Supplementary notes \n \n65 \n7.5 \nSupplementary notes  \nMethods for finding the top few trees \nKruskal’s algorithm finds the optimal tree. There are also fast algorithms that can find \nthe top 𝑘 trees, for any 𝑘∈{1, … , 𝑝𝑝−2}, or all the spanning trees in order from best to \nworst. See Gabow (1977), Camerini et al (1980), Eppstein (1990), Sörensen & Janssens \n(2005), or Climaco et al (2008). Cowell (2013) uses the algorithm of Sörensen & \nJanssens (2005) to find the most likely pedigree charts for a group of animals or \nhumans.  \nOther edge-weights in the Chow–Liu algorithm \nThe algorithm in section 7.1 does not have to be done with these exact weights on the \nedges. Transforming the edge-weights by any monotone increasing function makes no \ndifference. For more on this see Acid et al (1991).  \nImprovements to the Chow–Liu algorithm \nNumerous papers have proposed improvements to the Chow–Liu algorithm and \nadaptations of it. For example, Alcobe (2002) gives an “incremental” method to imple-\nment the Chow–Liu algorithm in the case where data come in one at a time and you \nneed to update the tree after each item of data. His computer experiments suggest that \nit is much faster than running the Chow–Liu algorithm again from scratch each time. \nChoi et al (2011) gives two algorithms for learning “latent” tree graphical models where \nsome variables are unobserved, which is NP-hard. They prove that the algorithms are \nasymptotically consistent and report the results of numerical experiments. Wang \n(2009) is similar.  \nMeilă (1999) presents a way of speeding up the Chow–Liu algorithm if the data are \nsparse, by comparing some mutual informations without actually calculating them. \nZaffalon & Hutter (2005) is an adaptation of the Chow–Liu algorithm that apparently \ngives results that are more robust to the random variation in the data, by using the \n“imprecise Dirichlet model” to model the prior uncertainty about the data, which are \ndiscrete-valued.  \nPelleg & Moore (2006) present a way of speeding up the Chow–Liu algorithm for large \ndatasets by maintaining confidence intervals on the edge-weights. Their maximum-\nweight spanning tree algorithm works down from the complete graph to a tree. When \ntwo edges need to be compared but their confidence intervals overlap, they look at \nmore data to shrink one of them and make a decision. Naturally this method does not \nalways find the optimal tree.  \nOther research based on the Chow–Liu algorithm \nGupta et al (2010) is about learning forest graphical models using non-parametric \nkernel density estimates on each node and pair of nodes, using a method based on \nChow & Liu’s. Fleischer et al (2005) consider the NP-hard problem of finding the \nminimum spanning tree where both the edges and the “inner nodes” (the nodes that \nare not leaves) have weights.  \n\n7 The Chow–Liu algorithm \n \n 66 \nIn machine learning there has been research on “mixture of trees” models (Meilă & \nJordan 2000), in which the joint density consists of a weighted sum of the densities of \nseveral tree distributions. Mixture-of-trees models can be regarded as having an \nunobserved variable that chooses one of the trees; each separate tree distribution is a \nconditional distribution given that the unobserved variable chose that tree. Meilă & \nJordan (2000)’s method for learning a mixture-of-trees model from data is a \ncombination of the EM algorithm, for the unobserved variable, and Chow–Liu, for each \nof the trees. See also Kollin & Koivisto (2006) or Kumar & Koller (2009).  \nVincent Tan and his collaborators have produced several papers based on the Chow–Liu \nalgorithm. In Tan et al (2010a) they calculate the “error exponent” for the maximum-\nlikelihood estimator of the tree structure. Measuring the difficulty of learning a graph \nby the error exponent, they prove that the star graph (consisting of a hub and its spokes \nonly) is the hardest to learn and the chain graph (with all the nodes in a line) is the \neasiest. See section 11.1 for other senses in which these graphs are extremal. Tan et al \n(2010c) is about hypothesis tests to decide which of two trees or forests a sample \ncomes from, Tan et al (2010b) is about learning two tree graphical models for the \npurpose of classifying future observations into one of two categories, and Tan et al \n(2010d) is about learning forests for discrete graphical models by removing edges from \nthe Chow–Liu tree.  \n \n\n \n67 \n8 \nMethods for factored \ndistributions on trees \n8.1 \nIntroduction and the Matrix Tree Theorem \nThis chapter is about methods for analyzing factored distributions on trees, in \nparticular factored posterior distributions. For a factored distribution on trees, Meilă & \nJaakkola (2006) showed how to find the normalizing constant and certain other \nquantities in polynomial time, rather than by calculating the unnormalized probabilities \nof all the possible trees and summing them, which would be much slower. (Factored \ndistributions were discussed in section 5.4. The main ideas in the chapter were \nmentioned briefly and without details in two presentations, Lauritzen 2006 and 2012.)  \nMeilă & Jaakkola (2006) presented their theorems in the context of Bayesian structure-\nlearning for discrete-valued graphical models. Section 8.2 gives a summary of their \nrelevant results and several new examples of questions they can be used to answer. In \nsection 8.3 I show how these methods can be used for GGM structure-learning. Section \n8.4 is a review of methods for generating trees and forests from factored distributions.  \nThe methods in this chapter are based on the Matrix Tree Theorem (MTT), or more \nprecisely a version of it that I will call the Weighted Matrix Tree Theorem (WMTT). \nMTT gives a way to calculate how many spanning trees a given graph has, and WMTT \ngives an explicit way of finding all the spanning trees. Section 8.5 describes the origins \nof these two theorems and includes references to publications that contain proofs of \nthem.  \nMatrix Tree Theorem (MTT). For an undirected graph 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸), where 𝑉= {1, … , 𝑝}, \ndefine the Laplacian matrix 𝐿 by  \n𝐿𝑖𝑗= {\n −1  if (𝑖, 𝑗) ∈𝐸\n deg(𝑖)   if 𝑖= 𝑗\n 0  otherwise.   \n \nThe number of spanning trees of 𝐺 equals the absolute value of any minor of 𝐿. (A \nminor of a matrix is the determinant of the matrix formed by removing one row and \none column.)  \nWeighted Matrix Tree Theorem (WMTT). Let 𝐺 be as above. On each edge (𝑖, 𝑗), put an \nindeterminate variable 𝑥𝑖𝑗. Define 𝐿 by  \n\n8 Methods for factored distributions on trees \n \n 68 \n𝐿𝑖𝑗=\n{\n \n \n \n −𝑥𝑖𝑗                   if (𝑖, 𝑗) ∈𝐸  \n ∑\n𝑥𝑖𝑘\n𝑘:(𝑖,𝑘)∈𝐸\n  if 𝑖= 𝑗           \n0                         otherwise.   \n \nLet 𝑀 be the absolute value of any of the minors of 𝐿, and for a spanning tree 𝑇=\n(𝑉, 𝐸𝑇), let ℎ(𝑇) = ∏\n𝑥𝑖𝑗\n(𝑖,𝑗)∈𝐸𝑇\n. Then 𝑀= ∑ℎ(𝑇)\n𝑇\n, where the sum is over all spanning \ntrees of 𝐺.  \n \nIn other words, each monomial term in 𝑀, when it is simplified, corresponds to one \npossible spanning tree. (A monomial is a product of powers of variables.) If 𝑥𝑖𝑗= 1 for \nall (𝑖, 𝑗) ∈𝐸 then 𝐿 is just the Laplacian matrix and WMTT reduces to MTT.  \nHere is an example of WMTT. It can also be regarded as an example of MTT, by replacing \nall the 𝑥𝑖𝑗’s by 1. The graph is shown on the left in Figure 8.1. The matrix is  \n𝐿= (\n𝑥12 + 𝑥14\n−𝑥12\n0\n−𝑥14\n−𝑥12\n𝑥12 + 𝑥23 + 𝑥24\n−𝑥23\n−𝑥24\n0\n−𝑥23\n𝑥23 + 𝑥34\n−𝑥34\n−𝑥14\n−𝑥24\n−𝑥34\n𝑥14 + 𝑥24 + 𝑥34\n) , \nand the absolute value of any of its minors will simplify to give \n𝑀= 𝑥12𝑥14𝑥23 + 𝑥12𝑥14𝑥34 + 𝑥12𝑥23𝑥24 + 𝑥12𝑥23𝑥34 \n               + 𝑥12𝑥24𝑥34 + 𝑥14𝑥23𝑥24 + 𝑥14𝑥23𝑥34 + 𝑥14𝑥24𝑥34. \nFor instance, the first monomial, 𝑥12𝑥14𝑥23, corresponds to the spanning tree shown on \nthe right in Figure 8.1. Setting all the 𝑥𝑖𝑗’s to 1 gives 𝑀= 8, which is the number of \nspanning trees of the graph.  \nAs another example, if 𝐺 is 𝐾3, the complete graph on 3 nodes, then 𝑀 simplifies to \n𝑥12𝑥13 + 𝑥12𝑥23 + 𝑥13𝑥23. The first monomial, 𝑥12𝑥13, corresponds to the tree with \nedges (1,2) and (1,3).  \n \n \nFigure 8.1. A graph (left), and the spanning tree of it that corresponds to 𝑥12𝑥14𝑥23 in WMTT.  \n \nMany proofs of MTT work by first showing that the absolute values of the minors are all \nequal. They then use the Binet–Cauchy theorem (Lancaster & Tismenetsky 1985, \n\n \n8.2 The normalizing constant for discrete-valued tree graphical models \n \n69 \nsection 2.5) to express one of the minors in terms of determinants of smaller matrices. \nThese determinants are ±1 if the corresponding subgraph is a spanning tree and 0 \notherwise.  \n8.2 \nThe normalizing constant for discrete-valued tree \ngraphical models \nFor factored distributions on the set of trees, Meilă & Jaakkola (2006) show how to \ncalculate the normalizing constant in polynomial time, using WMTT. Without their \nmethod this would be impractical, since the obvious way to calculate this quantity \nrequires summing over all possible trees, and the number of possible trees is super-\nexponential.  \nThe main theorem follows from applying WMTT to the complete graph 𝐾𝑝. Suppose you \nhave a factored distribution on trees, defined as in equation (1) in section 5.4. In WMTT, \nlet each of the indeterminate variables 𝑥𝑖𝑗 equal the corresponding edge-factor 𝑤𝑒=\n𝑤(𝑖,𝑗) from the factored distribution. Now WMTT states that 𝑀= ∑ℎ(𝑇)\n𝑇\n, where the \nsum is over all the spanning trees of 𝐺, in other words all the trees. But  \nℎ(𝑇) =\n∏𝑥𝑖𝑗\n(𝑖,𝑗)∈𝐸𝑇\n= ∏𝑤𝑒\n𝑒∈𝐸𝑇\n∝ℙ(𝑇). \nThe normalizing constant for the factored distribution is  \n∑∏𝑤𝑒\n𝑒∈𝐸𝑇\n𝑇\n= ∑ℎ(𝑇)\n𝑇\n= 𝑀, \nwhich can be calculated in polynomial time using standard algorithms for calculating \ndeterminants.  \nMeilă & Jaakkola (2006) is about Bayesian structure-learning for discrete-valued tree \ngraphical models. Undirected tree graphical models are equivalent to rooted-tree DAG \ngraphical models, and they use both forms. They show that if certain reasonable-\nsounding assumptions about the parameters of the discrete distribution are satisfied, \nthen the prior distributions of these parameters must be a product of Dirichlet distri-\nbutions. It then follows that if the prior distribution on the graph structure is factored, \nthen so is the posterior. (The abstract says the posterior “can be completely determined \nanalytically in polynomial time”, but calculating the entire posterior distribution in \npolynomial time is impossible since the number of trees, and hence the amount of \ninformation in the posterior, is super-exponential.)  \nBeing able to calculate the normalizing constant means that the posterior probability of \nany given tree can be calculated exactly. Meilă & Jaakkola (2006) also show that under a \nfactored distribution, the expectations of real-valued “additive” or “multiplicative” \nfunctions of trees can be calculated quickly by using derivatives of the normalizing \nconstant (expressed as a function of the edge-factors). A function 𝑓 is additive if it is of \nthe form 𝑓((𝑉, 𝐸)) = ∑\n𝑓𝑢𝑣\n(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸\n, where 𝑓𝑢𝑣 are weights on the edges, and multi-\nplicative if it is of the form 𝑓((𝑉, 𝐸)) = ∏\n𝑓𝑢𝑣\n(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸\n.  \n\n8 Methods for factored distributions on trees \n \n 70 \nI will now show that several useful quantities to do with factored posterior distri-\nbutions can be calculated using very simple additive functions. Let 𝑓= 𝕀(𝑖,𝑗)∈𝐸. This is \nthe indicator function for the edge (𝑖, 𝑗). This is obviously additive, with  \n𝑓𝑢𝑣= { 1 if {𝑢, 𝑣} = {𝑖, 𝑗}\n 0 otherwise.           \nThe method of Meilă & Jaakkola (2006) can therefore be used to calculate 𝔼(𝑓(𝐸)) in \nthe posterior distribution. This is simply the posterior probability that the edge is in the \ngraph, ℙ((𝑖, 𝑗) ∈𝐸), which could very easily be a quantity of interest.  \nLet 𝑝𝑖𝑗= ℙ((𝑖, 𝑗) ∈𝐸), and suppose that this has been calculated for every possible \nedge. If the data was simulated from a distribution with a known graph structure \n(𝑉, 𝐸𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒), then the expected number of true-positives, another quantity that might be \nof \ninterest, \nis ∑\n𝑝𝑢𝑣\n(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒\n. \nThe \nexpected \nnumber \nof \nfalse-positives \nis \n∑\n𝑝𝑢𝑣\n(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸𝑎𝑙𝑙∖𝐸𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒\n, and other related quantities can be found in similar ways. (See \nsection 10.2 for more on these quantities.)  \nThe degree of 𝑖 is ∑\n𝕀(𝑣,𝑖)∈𝐸\n𝑣≠𝑖\n, so the expected degree of 𝑖 is 𝔼(deg(𝑖)) = ∑\n𝑝𝑣𝑖\n𝑣≠𝑖\n. \nAlternatively, the expected degree of 𝑖 can be calculated directly, using  \n𝑓𝑢𝑣= { 1  if 𝑢= 𝑖 or 𝑣= 𝑖\n 0  otherwise.             \nThe value of the corresponding additive function 𝑓 is deg(𝑖).  \nIn these ways several quantities that might be of interest can be expressed in terms of \nthe 𝑝𝑖𝑗’s. One quantity that cannot is the expected maximum degree. Finding this \nrequires quantities like ℙ(deg(𝑖) = 1). This cannot be calculated using additive or \nmultiplicative functions, because it is the expectation of 𝕀{deg(𝑖) = 1}, which is not just \nthe sum or product of fixed weights on the edges.  \nOther limitations of these methods are that they do not work with general prior \ndistributions and they do not work with forests—essentially because there is no MTT \nfor forests. Another possible drawback is that in Bayesian structure-learning it may be \npreferable to work with only a subset of the possible models, rather than average over \nall of them. Madigan & Raftery (1994), for example, argue that models with much lower \nprobability than the best ones should be discarded completely.  \n8.3 \nThe normalizing constant for GGMs \nHow the methods work for GGMs \nMeilă & Jaakkola (2006) mention that their results still work with GGMs and Bayesian \nlearning of tree-structure but do not give any details. For GGMs, if the uniform graph \nprior on trees is used, the posterior is \nℙ( 𝐺∣𝑥) ∝(2𝜋)−𝑛𝑝/2 ∏𝐾(𝑣) \n𝑣∈𝑉\n∏\n𝐾(𝑢, 𝑣)\n𝐾(𝑢)𝐾(𝑣) \n(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸\n, \n\n \n8.3 The normalizing constant for GGMs \n \n71 \nwhere 𝑥 is the 𝑛× 𝑝 matrix of observed data and 𝐾 is defined in section 7.4. (The \nexpression for 𝐾 involves 𝑈= 𝑥𝑇𝑥 and the HIW hyperparameters, but 𝐾 is written as a \nfunction of one or two nodes for simplicity.)  \nThis is clearly a factored distribution, with the weight on edge (𝑢, 𝑣) being \n𝐾(𝑢,𝑣)\n𝐾(𝑢)𝐾(𝑣). It \nfollows that all the facts and methods in the previous section can be used. For Bayesian \nstructure-learning on forests, \n𝐾(𝑢,𝑣)\n𝐾(𝑢)𝐾(𝑣) can be regarded as the Bayes factor for the \npresence of the edge (𝑢, 𝑣), as mentioned in section 7.4 and Lauritzen (2006, 2012).  \nIf the graph prior is factored then the results in the previous section still hold. If the \nprior is  \nℙ(𝐺) ∝∏𝑤𝑒\n𝑒∈𝐸\n , \nthen the posterior is  \nℙ( 𝐺∣𝑥) ∝\n∏𝑤(𝑢,𝑣)\n𝐾(𝑢, 𝑣)\n𝐾(𝑢)𝐾(𝑣) \n(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸\n, \nwhich is clearly a factored distribution.  \nIn the computer experiments in section 11.5, Meilă & Jaakkola (2006)’s methods are \nused for finding the expected true-positive rate under the posterior distribution. The \nlimitations of their methods are the same in the case of GGMs as they are for discrete-\nvalued graphical models.  \nA computer program for GGMs \nI have written a computer program that uses the MTT-based method to find the \nnormalizing constant, the expected degree of each node, and the expected number of \ntrue positives, for GGMs. I used this to produce the results in section 11.5. The input to \nthe program is the data and the prior values of the HIW hyperparameters. But the input \nto the subroutines that actually perform the MTT-based methods is just the symmetric \nmatrix of edge-factors that defines the posterior distribution. So the program could \neasily be adapted to work with any factored prior.  \nFor 𝑝= 30, the normalizing constant is beyond the range of the usual double-precision \nfloating-point numbers that are used by computers. But it can be found if you use \nspecial classes and packages for arbitrary- or high-precision decimals. In the Java \nprogramming language, objects of the BigDecimal class (Oracle 2012) are stored as \n𝑥× 10𝑦 where 𝑥∈{0,1, … }  and 𝑦∈{−231, −231 + 1, … , 231 −1} . The size of 𝑥 is \nlimited only by the size of the Java virtual machine, which in turn is limited by the host \ncomputer. Matrix algebra with BigDecimals can be done using any of the classes that \nimplements the FieldMatrix interface in the Commons Math package (Apache Software \nFoundation 2012). These classes and packages are of a high quality, though arithmetic \nwith them is naturally slower than with the usual floating-point decimals.  \nOn the topic of high-precision arithmetic, Wang & Li (2012) say that their methods may \nneed to calculate quantities such as 𝑒−10000, but “to our knowledge, [no] current soft-\n\n8 Methods for factored distributions on trees \n \n 72 \nware for Gaussian graphical models has yet supported this level of precision.” Perhaps \nmy program for the MTT-based methods is the first. Lauritzen (2006) says certain \nalgorithms for forests do not work well because most of the values are essentially zero. \nBigDecimal might be able to overcome these problems.  \n8.4 \nGenerating random trees or forests \nAs discussed in sections 5.1 and 5.7, one of the main things you might want to do with a \ngraph distribution is generate from it. This section is a review of methods for \ngenerating spanning trees or forests of a given graph according to a uniform or factored \ndistribution. For Bayesian learning of tree graphical models, the given graph would be \n𝐾𝑝. (Generating from uniform distributions has no purpose in graphical model \nstructure-learning but is closely related to generating from factored distributions.)  \nPropp & Wilson (1998) give a history of the algorithms for generating a spanning tree \nuniformly at random. The first one was by Guénoche (1983) and a faster algorithm \nappears in Colbourn et al (1989). The basic idea is that if you repeatedly choose an \nedge uniformly at random and discard it if it creates a cycle, you will not get the uniform \ndistribution. But if you go through the edges and accept each one according to the \nproportion of spanning trees that contain it, then you will. This proportion can be \ncalculated using MTT. The same idea works for factored distributions, using WMTT—\nsee Kulkarni (1990).  \nA different type of algorithm for generating a spanning tree was discovered by Broder \n(1989) and Aldous (1990). Do a simple random walk on the graph until you have \nvisited every node. For each node apart from the first one, record the edge by which the \nnode was first visited. The set of these edges constitutes a spanning tree chosen uni-\nformly at random.  \nPropp & Wilson (1998) give two algorithms for generating from a uniform or factored \ndistribution. One uses “coupling from the past”, which is a way of generating exactly \nfrom the invariant distribution of an ergodic Markov chain that has a finite number of \nstates. The other uses “cycle-popping”.  \nGenerating forests from a factored distribution is much more difficult. Dai (2008) \npresents two sets of algorithms for this problem. (He uses “forests” to mean subgraphs \nof a given graph that contain all its nodes and have no cycles.) The first set uses \ncoupling from the past and the second set uses rejection methods. The main rejection-\ntype algorithm is 8: add an extra node and edges from it to all the other nodes, run one \nof the algorithms for generating a random tree, remove the extra node and the edges \nthat include it, and then accept this forest with a certain probability.  \n8.5 \nSupplementary notes: the history of MTT \nMeilă & Jaakkola (2006) state that their main theorem was first proved in Jaakkola et al \n(2000) but that they later discovered a similar result, which must have been WMTT, in \nHarary (1967). The idea of using WMTT to find the normalizing constant for random \ntrees appears implicitly in Kulkarni (1990). It was also conceived independently by Koo \n\n \n8.5 Supplementary notes: the history of MTT \n \n73 \net al (2007), Smith & Smith (2007), and McDonald & Satta (2007), in the field of \ncomputational linguistics.  \nMTT and WMTT, or theorems that are essentially equivalent to them, were known in the \n19th century and rediscovered multiple times in the 20th. Moon (1970, page 42) and \nKnuth (1997, pages 583 and 586) give detailed accounts of their origins. Kirchhoff \n(1847) is often credited with MTT or WMTT. His main result is essentially the same as \nWMTT, but it is about the dual problem of finding all the sets of edges that can be \nremoved to leave a tree. A similar version appears in Maxwell (1892, pages 403–410). \nThese publications are about electrical circuits and resistances, and some mental \nexertion is needed to interpret them as graph theory. In mathematics, a version of \nWMTT appears in Cayley (1856) and Sylvester (1857). Books that contain proofs of \nWMTT include Moon (1970) and Bollobás (1998, page 57), and of course MTT follows \nfrom WMTT.  \nThe normalizing constant is called the “normalization constant” in Meilă & Jaakkola \n(2006). It is also known as the “partition function”, for example in Murray & Ghahra-\nmani (2004).  \n \n\n \n74 \n9 \nLocal moves in forests and trees \n9.1 \nPreamble  \nAlgorithmic graph theory (Even 1979, Gibbons 1985) is mostly about solving problems \nfor given graphs. Typical problems are testing whether a graph is planar or colouring \nthe nodes so that no two adjacent nodes have the same colour. Chapter 6 of Bondy & \nMurty (2008) is called “Tree-search algorithms”. This includes breadth-first search, \ndepth-first search, and algorithms to find minimum-weight spanning trees, shortest \npaths, and so on.  \nIn contrast, this chapter is about algorithms for storing and manipulating graphs, with a \nview to exploring the posterior graph distribution in graphical model structure-\nlearning. The main algorithms are designed for manipulating graphs by repeatedly \nadding and deleting edges. The main issue is how to store the graph in order to take \nadvantage of the information from the previous step, avoid wasteful repeated searches \nthrough the graph, and enable the information that is stored to be updated in an \nefficient way.  \nIn computer programs there are two common ways to store undirected graphs. The first \nis the adjacency matrix. This is usually a symmetric square matrix of 1s and 0s but can \nalso be regarded and stored as a triangular matrix, or a square or triangular matrix of \nbooleans. The other way is a list of edges. This is regarded as more suitable for sparse \ngraphs, since it uses less memory. Forests and trees can be stored in a different way by \nregarding each component as a rooted tree, with arbitrary root, and storing just the \nparent of each node, or “null” if it is a root.  \n9.2 \nStoring forests and trees for local moves  \nThe purposes of the algorithms \nAs mentioned in section 3.1, in Bayesian analysis of the graph structure it is impossible \nto calculate the posterior probability of all the 2(𝑝\n2) possible graphs on 𝑝 nodes. For \ndecomposable graphs there are reversible-jump MCMC algorithms for sampling from \nthe posterior distribution of the graph structure and the covariance matrix (Giudici & \nGreen 1999, Green & Thomas 2013). Jones et al (2005) proposed a stochastic search \nalgorithm for moving through the space of all possible graphs and calculating the exact \nposterior probabilities of the graphs that are visited. Restricted versions of these \nalgorithms can be applied to forests, and adapted versions of them can be applied to \ntrees. (Details are given in section 10.1.)  \n\n \n9.2 Storing forests and trees for local moves \n \n75 \nConsider a Bayesian analysis in which attention is restricted to forests. To explore the \nposterior distribution of the graph structure the most obvious, natural, and “local” type \nof move is to add or delete one edge at a time. For trees, the most obvious type of move \nis to move an edge. (I use the word “move” with two different meanings. For forests a \nmove means adding or deleting an edge; for trees it means literally moving an edge \nfrom one position to another. I treat forests and trees completely separately, so there \nshould be no ambiguity.)  \nFor forests, it is easy to describe which edges can be added and removed while ensuring \nthat the graph is still a forest. Any existing edge can be removed, and an edge can be \nadded if and only if its two nodes are in different connected components. For trees, it is \nsimilarly easy to describe which moves are possible. First choose an edge, temporarily \nremove it, and identify the two connected components that result; the edge can then be \nput back between any two nodes that are not both in the same connected component. \n(Two alternative ways of making moves in trees are described in the last paragraph of \nthis subsection.)  \nThese conditions are easy to describe verbally, but they are less easy to program or \nwrite in the form of detailed algorithms, and they are time-consuming to carry out. To \nsee whether a particular move is possible it is necessary to identify connected compo-\nnents. Identifying a connected component means doing a breadth-first search, or \npossibly a depth-first search, through the component (Golumbic 1980, pages 37–42; \nCormen et al 2009, pages 594–612). This means finding all the neighbours of a node at \neach step. Finding several or all of the possible moves from the current graph, which is \nnecessary for the algorithm of Jones et al (2005), would require doing all of this many \ntimes. It is efficient and elegant to be able to choose a move straight away, rather than \nhaving to choose one, test whether it is a legal move, and if not then reject it and repeat. \nAnother issue is to do with how to choose moves randomly for MCMC proposal \ndistributions or other algorithms that explore the graph space. To achieve good mixing, \nit may be desirable to be able to choose a move uniformly at random from among all the \npossible moves.  \nSection 9.3 describes how to store a forest in such a way that it is easy to choose a legal \nmove uniformly at random, and how to update the stored information after a move. \nSection 9.4 describes an analogous system for trees. These systems make it simple to \nprogram graph-search algorithms that choose these moves uniformly at random. They \nare computationally efficient because the update algorithms are “local”—they never \nneed to search through all the nodes or all the edges. (On the other hand, the algorithms \nthat store the graph, and check that it is a forest or tree, are not local and do search \nthrough all the nodes. But these usually only need to be done once.)  \nFor exploring the space of decomposable graphs, Thomas & Green (2009a, b) state that \nit is desirable to be able to find a decomposable neighbouring graph straight away, not \nby choosing a random neighbour and then checking whether it is decomposable. (A \n“neighbour” of a graph is a graph formed by making one move from it.) The reason is \nthat for large 𝑝 the former way should be much faster. This is essentially the same as the \nmain reason behind my approach for forests and trees.  \n\n9 Local moves in forests and trees \n \n 76 \nThere are at least two alternative ways of making basic moves on trees. The first is in \nPropp & Wilson (1998, page 196) and is for rooted trees. Choose a node, other than the \nroot, to be the new root; draw an edge from the new root to the old root; and delete the \nedge that goes in to the new root. The second is from Climaco et al (2008). Add an edge, \nidentify the cycle that results, and then remove an edge from the cycle.  \nHow the algorithms are shown  \nIn the following subsections, each algorithm is preceded by an explanation of what it \ndoes and how it works. The algorithms are written in a style that is intended to be easy \nto translate into computer code. The right-hand columns contain verbal descriptions of \nwhat is being done, where this is not completely obvious, and other comments.  \n• \nAlgorithms V and VIII, for storing the graph and checking its properties, assume \nthat the graph is supplied in the form of its adjacency matrix, 𝐴.  \n• \n𝑋←𝑌 means that 𝑋 is assigned the value 𝑌. \n• \nFor loops, the scope is shown by indentation. \n• \nWhereas in directed graphs 𝑝𝑎(𝑣) is usually a set, here it is a single node, because \nall the connected components are rooted trees.  \nNotation and partitions \nThe algorithms are written in pseudo-code or plain English rather than traditional set-\ntheory notation. One reason for this is that they use partitions. A partition of a set 𝑍 is a \nset {𝑍1, … , 𝑍𝑘} such that 𝑍𝑖∩𝑍𝑗= ∅ for all 𝑖≠𝑗 and ⋃\n𝑍𝑖\n𝑘\n𝑖=1\n= 𝑍. The 𝑍𝑖’s are called \n“parts”. Simple operations such as “move 𝑣 to a new part” are long and difficult to read \nwhen written in set-theory notation.  \nIn programming, probably the most natural way to work with a partition is to store it as \na pair of associative arrays. In one associative array, each key is an object (an element of \n𝑍), and the value associated with this key is the “label” of the part that the object is in. \nThe labels can be positive integers. In the other associative array, each key is the label of \na part, and the value associated with this key is the set of objects that are in this part. \nQueries of the form “which part is this object in?” and “which objects does this part \ncontain?” can be answered quickly and easily since they each involve just a single look-\nup. When an object is moved from one part to another, both the associative arrays have \nto be updated.  \nFacts about rooted trees \nHere are several simple results about rooted trees that are used by the algorithms. As \nstated in section 2.1, in directed graphs I use “path” to mean “undirected path”.  \nDefinition 9.1. A rooted tree is a directed tree in which one node is designated the root \nand the paths from the root to all the other nodes are directed paths. (In other words, \nall the edges point away from the root.)  \nRooted trees can also be defined as directed trees with any of the following three \nproperties. Proofs that the definitions are equivalent are omitted.  \n• \nThe root is an ancestor of all the other nodes.  \n\n \n9.2 Storing forests and trees for local moves \n \n77 \n• \nThe root has no parents, and all the other nodes have exactly one parent each.  \n• \nFor each edge, the node nearer to the root is the parent and the node further from \nthe root is the child (where “nearer” and “further” refer to the length of the path \nfrom the node to the root).  \nRooted trees are especially easy to deal with in algorithms and computer programs. \nTogether with each node are stored references to its children, and together with each \nnode except the root is stored a reference to its parent. Obviously 𝑛𝑒(𝑣) = {𝑝𝑎(𝑣)} ∪\n𝑐ℎ(𝑣). It is trivially easy to find the path from 𝑣 to the root—this is simply 𝑣, 𝑝𝑎(𝑣), \n𝑝𝑎(𝑝𝑎(𝑣)), …, until you get to the root. It is easy to find all the descendants of 𝑣, by \n“fanning down” from 𝑣 to its children, then all their children, and so on—this is done in \nAlgorithms VII and IX.  \nIn Algorithms V–VII, for forests, each connected component of the graph is regarded as \na rooted tree. In Algorithms VIII–IX, for trees, the whole graph is regarded as a rooted \ntree. The directions on the edges are just for the purpose of computational convenience. \nThey do not have any meaning in the graphical models.  \nDefinition 9.2. In a directed graph 𝐺, a reverse-directed path (𝑢, 𝑢1, … , 𝑢𝑘, 𝑣) is a path \nsuch that (𝑣, 𝑢𝑘, … , 𝑢1, 𝑢) is a directed path in 𝐺.  \nProposition 9.3 defines the “youngest common ancestor” of two nodes in a rooted tree \nand gives some of its properties.  \nProposition 9.3. For any two nodes 𝑢 and 𝑣 in a rooted tree, there is a unique node 𝑤 \nthat has the following properties:  \n• \n𝑢, 𝑣∈{𝑤} ∪𝑑𝑒(𝑤), and  \n• \nall nodes 𝑥 such that 𝑢, 𝑣∈{𝑥} ∪𝑑𝑒(𝑥) are on the path between 𝑤 and the root.  \nI will call 𝑤 the “youngest common ancestor” of 𝑢 and 𝑣. (Note that 𝑤 might be equal to \n𝑢 or 𝑣, so it is not necessarily one of their ancestors.) It also has this property:  \n• \n𝑤 is on the path between 𝑢 and 𝑣.  \nProof. Let 𝑃 be the reverse-directed path from 𝑢 to the root, and let 𝑋= {𝑥∈𝑉: 𝑢, 𝑣∈\n{𝑥} ∪𝑑𝑒(𝑥)}. If 𝑥∈𝑋 then 𝑥∈{𝑢} ∪𝑎𝑛(𝑢). This means there is a reverse-directed path \nfrom 𝑢 to 𝑥. Each node has at most one parent, so 𝑥 must lie on 𝑃. Therefore all \nelements of 𝑋 are in 𝑃. (It is not strictly true that “𝑋⊆𝑃”, since 𝑃 is a sequence.)  \nLet 𝑤 be the first element of 𝑃 that is in 𝑋. Since 𝑢, 𝑣∈{𝑤} ∪𝑑𝑒(𝑤), it follows that \n{𝑢, 𝑣} ⊂𝑑𝑒(𝑝𝑎(𝑤)) ⊂𝑑𝑒(𝑝𝑎(𝑝𝑎(𝑤))) ⊂⋯⊂𝑑𝑒(𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑡). This says that all the sub-\nsequent elements of 𝑃 are also in 𝑋. So 𝑋 consists of the nodes on the reverse-directed \npath from 𝑤 to the root. This shows the existence and uniqueness of the node that has \nthe first two properties.  \nAs for the third property, let the unique path from 𝑢 to 𝑤 be (𝑢, 𝑢1, … , 𝑢𝑘, 𝑤) and the \nunique path from 𝑣 to 𝑤 be (𝑣, 𝑣1, … , 𝑣𝑙, 𝑤). None of the 𝑢𝑖’s can be the same as any of \nthe 𝑣𝑗’s, because if 𝑢𝑖= 𝑣𝑗 then this node would be 𝑤. So the unique path from 𝑢 to 𝑣 is \n(𝑢, 𝑢1, … , 𝑢𝑘, 𝑤, 𝑣𝑙, … , 𝑣1, 𝑣), and this contains 𝑤.  \n\n9 Local moves in forests and trees \n \n 78 \nAn alternative way of proving Proposition 9.3 is by noting that for any three nodes in a \ntree, the three paths between them have exactly one node in common. If the three nodes \nare taken to be 𝑢, 𝑣, and the root, then the node that the paths have in common is 𝑤.  \nProposition 9.4. Let 𝑣 be a node in a rooted tree. If you reverse all the edges on the path \nfrom the root to 𝑣, the result is a rooted tree with 𝑣 as its root. \nProof. A tree is rooted at 𝑟 if and only if, for all 𝑢∈𝑉, there is a directed path from 𝑟 to 𝑢. \nConsider any node 𝑢∈𝑉, and let 𝑤 be the youngest common ancestor of 𝑢 and 𝑣 \n(where 𝑣 is the node mentioned in the proposition). All the ancestors of 𝑣 lie on the \npath from 𝑟 to 𝑣, so 𝑤 must lie on this path. After the edges are reversed, there is a new \ndirected path from 𝑣 to 𝑤, and the old directed path from 𝑤 to 𝑢 is still there. So there is \na directed path from 𝑣 to 𝑢, which means the new graph is a rooted tree with root 𝑣. All \nthese statements still hold if any two or more of 𝑟, 𝑢, 𝑣, and 𝑤 are equal, or if two \ndifferent pairs of them are equal.   \nProposition 9.5. Suppose 𝐵= (𝑉𝐵, 𝐸𝐵) is a rooted tree with root 𝑏, 𝐶= (𝑉𝐶, 𝐸𝐶) is a \nrooted tree with root 𝑐, 𝑉𝐵∩𝑉𝐶= ∅, and 𝑣∈𝑉𝐵. Let 𝐷 be the graph formed by \ncombining 𝐵 and 𝐶 and adding the edge (𝑣, 𝑐), so 𝐷= (𝑉𝐵∪𝑉𝐶, 𝐸𝐵∪𝐸𝐶∪(𝑣, 𝑐)). Then \n𝐷 is a rooted tree with root 𝑏.  \nProof. A node 𝑢 in 𝐷 is either in 𝑉𝐵 or in 𝑉𝐶. If 𝑢∈𝑉𝐵, then there is obviously a unique \ndirected path from 𝑏 to 𝑢 in 𝐷, because 𝐵 is a rooted tree. If 𝑢∈𝑉𝐶, then a directed path \nfrom 𝑏 to 𝑢 in 𝐷 can be formed by combining, in order, the directed path from 𝑏 to 𝑣 \n(which exists because 𝐵 is a rooted tree), the edge (𝑣, 𝑐), and the directed path from 𝑐 \nto 𝑢 (which exists because 𝐶 is a rooted tree).  \n9.3 \nThe system for storing a forest  \nThe purpose of the system  \nThis section describes how to store a forest in such a way that it is easy to choose an \nedge-removal or edge-addition move uniformly at random from all the possible moves. \nFor this it is necessary to have available the set of edges that can be added and the set of \nedges that can be removed, so that one of these can be chosen uniformly at random. Any \nedge can be removed. The non-trivial issue is which edges can be added. This requires \nknowing whether two nodes are in the same connected component.  \nEach component of the forest is regarded as a rooted tree. There are three algorithms. \nAlgorithm V is for storing a forest and checking that it is a forest, Algorithm VI is for \nadding an edge, and Algorithm VII is for removing an edge.  \nReversing an edge is not a possible move, because this would violate the condition that \nthe components are rooted (in all cases except components with two nodes). Moreover, \nthe directions are only for computational convenience, so reversing an edge would not \nchange the graphical model.  \n\n \n9.3 The system for storing a forest \n \n79 \nWhat is stored \n• \nThe 𝑝 nodes.

The method for updating it is \ntrivial, so this is omitted from the algorithms. The point of storing the bit-pattern is that \nthe user will probably want to keep a record of some or all of the graphs that are visited. \nFor this it is not necessary to have all the detailed information about parents, children, \nand partitions, so just the bit-pattern can be used.  \nTo choose a move uniformly at random from among all the possible moves, simply \nchoose an edge uniformly at random from 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒∪𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔.

In the original graph before the \nedge is added, let 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 be the component that contains 𝑣 and 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 be the \ncomponent that contains 𝑢. In Figure 9.1, 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 is {⑧⑪①③⑤} and 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 \nis {⑨②⑥⑦}. When the new edge is added, 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 and 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 combine to \nform a new component.  \nProposition 9.6.

If at the initial step you choose the edge uniformly at random from \namong all the existing edges, then not all edge-moves will be equally likely. Consider the \ntree in Figure 9.3. If you choose and remove edge A, then there are 6 places it can be \nreinserted (while making sure the graph is still a tree); so choosing A is the first step in \n6 possible edge-moves. But if you choose and remove edge B, there are 4 × 3 = 12 \nplaces it can be reinserted; choosing B is the first step in 12 possible edge-moves. To \nchoose the edge-move uniformly at random, you need to be twice as likely to choose B \nas to choose 𝐴.  \n \n \nFigure 9.3. A tree. To choose an edge-move uniformly at random from among all the possible \nedge-moves, you need to have ℙ(choose edge 𝐵) = 2ℙ(choose edge 𝐴). \n \nIn general, to be able to choose an edge-move uniformly at random, it is necessary to \nknow for each edge the sizes of the two connected components that would result from \nremoving that edge. The most convenient way to store this information is by assigning a \n“weight” to each node except the root. The weight of each node is the number of its \ndescendants plus one and will be denoted by 𝑊(⋅). If the edge between 𝑣 and 𝑝𝑎(𝑣) is \nremoved, then the sizes of the two connected components are 𝑊(𝑣) and 𝑝−𝑊(𝑣), and \nthe edge can be reinserted in any of 𝑊(𝑣) × (𝑝−𝑊(𝑣)) possible places.  \nSo the procedure to choose an edge-move uniformly at random is as follows. Choose a \nnode at random, with the probability of node 𝑣 being proportional to 𝑊(𝑣) × (𝑝−\n𝑊(𝑣)). Remove the edge between 𝑣 and 𝑝𝑎(𝑣). From each of the two connected \ncomponents, choose one node uniformly at random. Finally, reinsert the edge between \nthese two nodes.  \n\n9 Local moves in forests and trees \n \n 84 \nThe most complicated part of this system is the updates of the node-weights after the \nedge-move. This is the main work of Algorithm IX.  \nAfter an edge is removed, the graph consists of two connected components. Hereafter \nthe component that contains the root will be called 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 and the other component \nwill be called 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝.  \nUsing uniformly chosen edge-moves \nChoosing an edge-move uniformly at random could be useful in a tree version of Giudici \n& Green (1999)’s MCMC method or Jones et al (2005)’s stochastic search method. In \none form of the latter method, all the neighbouring graphs are analyzed, so there is no \nneed to choose edge-moves uniformly at random. (It would still be convenient to store \nthe tree as a rooted tree, but there is no need for the weights.) In the general form, only \nsome of them are analyzed. It is easy to adapt Algorithm IX to produce not just one but \nany number of edge-moves uniformly at random from among all the possible edge-\nmoves.  \nThe idea of choosing edge-moves uniformly at random is that this may give better \nmixing among the possible graphs. For example, if you remove an edge that includes a \nleaf (a node of degree 1), then that node will definitely still be a leaf after the edge is \nreinserted. Section 11.1 will show that if you choose the edge to move uniformly at \nrandom, rather than choose the edge-move uniformly at random, then leaves are more \nlikely to remain leaves. Section 11.2 presents the results of experiments to see when \nchoosing edge-moves uniformly at random is beneficial.  \nTwo slightly different versions of the system \nWith the system described above, there is positive probability that the edge will be \nreinserted in the same place as it was removed from, so the “edge-move” will consist of \nthe graph staying the same. It is easy to adapt the method and the algorithms to avoid \nthis. When you calculate the probabilities, use 𝑊(𝑣) × (𝑝−𝑊(𝑣)) −1 instead of \n𝑊(𝑣) × (𝑝−𝑊(𝑣)), and when deciding where to reinsert the edge, exclude the original \nposition of the edge. (In the computer experiments in chapter 11, I use this adapted \nversion.)  \nIt would also be possible to store the weights on the edges rather than the nodes. The \nweight of each edge would be the number of nodes that are “downstream” of it—that is, \non the same side of the edge as the child. To convert from node-weights to edge-weights, \nfrom each node 𝑣 remove 𝑊(𝑣) and put it on (𝑣, 𝑝𝑎(𝑣)) instead. To choose an edge-\nmove uniformly at random, choose edge 𝑒 with probability proportional to 𝑊(𝑒) × (𝑝−\n𝑊(𝑒)).  \nWith weights on the edges, there is no need to treat the root as a special case. The \nupdates of the weights in 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 are also simpler to describe, since there is no need \nto talk about a path to “just before” 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟. Overall, using edge-weights is \nmore natural than using node-weights. But the differences are trivial, and with each \nnode you already have to store the parents and children, so in practice it is simpler to \nuse node-weights.  \n\n \n9.4 The system for storing a tree \n \n85 \nWhat is stored \n• \nThe 𝑝 nodes. The tree is regarded as a rooted tree. Each node 𝑣 stores references to \nits parent, 𝑝𝑎(𝑣), and its children, 𝑐ℎ(𝑣). The first node is the root and has no \nparent; some nodes have no children. The root never changes.  \n• \nEach node except for the root also stores a weight, which is the number of its \ndescendants plus one.  \n• \nThe bit-pattern that constitutes the lower triangle of the adjacency matrix. As with \nforests, the storing and updating of the bit-pattern are omitted from the algorithms.  \nAlgorithm VIII: store a tree, and check that it is a tree \nThe loop in lines 6–13 of Algorithm VIII is exactly the same as the inner loop of \nAlgorithm V (lines 7–14). It fans down from 𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑡 to identify one connected component \nof the graph. This time there are two ways the graph could fail to be a tree. Firstly, it \nmight have cycles, which is tested in line 9. Secondly, this one component might not \ninclude all the nodes, which is tested in line 14. \n \nAlgorithm VIII: store a tree, and check that it is a tree \nSet the nodes’ parents and children and check that it is a \ntree: \n \n1. 𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑←𝑉 \n \n2. 𝑤𝑎𝑖𝑡𝑙𝑖𝑠𝑡←∅ \n \n3.

Return 𝑊(𝑣) \n \nNotation for Algorithm IX \nAlgorithm IX chooses and makes an edge-move, and updates the edge-directions and \nnode-weights as necessary. Suppose the edge is moved from (𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑) to \n(𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑). Of course it is possible that 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡= 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 or \n𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑= 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑.  \nAfter (𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑) is removed, the graph has two connected components. Call \nthe component that contains the root 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 and the other component 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝. \n(The nodes in 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 might actually be “older” on average than the nodes in \n𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝, if the “age” of a node is such that each parent is 1 older than its children, but \nthis does not matter.)  \nTo preserve the rootedness of the tree, the direction of the new edge has to be from \n𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 to 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝. So 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡∈𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 and 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑∈𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝.  \nFacts used by Algorithm IX \nFigure 9.4 shows a typical edge-move and how the node-weights and edge-directions \nchange. This is intended to give an intuitive understanding of the propositions in this \nsection and how Algorithm IX works.  \nFigure 9.5 shows the eight different possibilities for the relative positions of 𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑡, \n𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡, and 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 in 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝. For example, if 𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑡 is on the path between \n𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 and 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡, then 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 looks like (c) in Figure 9.5; the configuration \nin Figure 9.4 is a special case of (d) in Figure 9.5.  \nThe propositions and proofs below all hold completely generally, whichever of the \npossibilities in Figure 9.5 holds for 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝, and even if 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑= 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑. For \nexample, if 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑= 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 then Proposition 9.7 simply states that no edge-\ndirections need to be changed.  \nRecall that because the graph is a tree, the path between any two nodes is unique.  \nProposition 9.7. If the edges on the path between 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 and 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 are reversed, \nthe graph that results will be a rooted tree whose root is the root of 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝.  \nProof. First note that 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 must be the root of 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝. This is because \n𝑝𝑎(𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑) used to be 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡, but the edge (𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑) has been \nremoved; so in 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝, 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 has no parent, which means it must be the root. \nThe proof then follows from Proposition 9.4 and Proposition 9.5 in the same way that \nProposition 9.6 does. Reversing the edges makes 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 into a tree rooted at \n𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑, \nand \nrelinking 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 and 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 with \nthe \nnew \nedge \n(𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑) then makes a rooted tree whose root is the root of 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝.  \nProposition 9.8. In 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝, the only nodes whose weights can possibly change are the \nones on the path between 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 and 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡.  \n\n \n9.4 The system for storing a tree \n \n87 \nProof. For conciseness I will sometimes regard a path as a set of nodes rather than a \nsequence. The proof will consist of gradually narrowing down the set of nodes whose \nweights can possibly change. Let 𝑣∈𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝. The weight of 𝑣 only changes if 𝑑𝑒(𝑣) \nchanges, where 𝑑𝑒(𝑣) = {𝑢∈𝑉: there exists a directed path from 𝑣 to 𝑢}. Let 𝑑𝑒𝑜𝑙𝑑(𝑣) \nbe the descendants of 𝑣 in the old graph, before the edge is moved, and 𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤(𝑣) be its \ndescendants in the new graph, after the edge is moved. Note that 𝑎𝑛(𝑣) does not change \nwhen the edge is moved, so there is no need for any subscript on it.  \nIt \nis \nsufficient \nto \nconsider \nnodes \nin  𝐹= {𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡} ∪𝑎𝑛(𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡) ∪  \n{𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡} ∪𝑎𝑛(𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡), since 𝑑𝑒𝑜𝑙𝑑(𝑣) ≠𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤(𝑣) is only possible if 𝑣∈𝐹. To \nsee this, first note that 𝑑𝑒𝑜𝑙𝑑(𝑣) ≠𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤(𝑣) means there exists some 𝑢 such that either \n𝑢∈𝑑𝑒𝑜𝑙𝑑(𝑣) and 𝑢∉𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤(𝑣) or 𝑢∈𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤(𝑣) and 𝑢∉𝑑𝑒𝑜𝑙𝑑(𝑣). If the former holds, \nthen the directed path from 𝑣 to 𝑢 in the old graph must include the edge \n(𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑), which implies that 𝑣∈{𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡} ∪𝑎𝑛(𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡). If the \nlatter holds, then the directed path from 𝑣 to 𝑢 in the new graph must include \n(𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑) , which implies that 𝑣∈{𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡} ∪𝑎𝑛(𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡) . \nCombining these two possibilities shows that 𝑑𝑒𝑜𝑙𝑑(𝑣) can only differ from 𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤(𝑣) if \n𝑣∈𝐹.  \nHowever, the proposition makes no claim about 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 or 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 themselves. \nSo it is sufficient to consider nodes in 𝐺= 𝑎𝑛(𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡) ∪𝑎𝑛(𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡). Let \n𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟 be the youngest common ancestor of 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 and 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡. By \nProposition 9.3, 𝑎𝑛(𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡) consists of 𝑎𝑛(𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟) and the directed \npath from 𝑤 to 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡, and 𝑎𝑛(𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡) consists of 𝑎𝑛(𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟) and \nthe directed path from 𝑤 to 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡. So 𝐺 is the union of 𝑎𝑛(𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟), the \npath from 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟 to 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡, and the path from 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟 to \n𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡. The union of these two paths is the path from 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 to 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 \n(this holds even if 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟= 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 or 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡). So 𝐺 is the union of \n𝑎𝑛(𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟) and the path from 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 to 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡.  \nTo prove the proposition it therefore suffices to check that if 𝑣∈𝑎𝑛(𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟) \nthen 𝑑𝑒𝑜𝑙𝑑(𝑣) = 𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤(𝑣). Suppose 𝑣∈𝑎𝑛(𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟). None of the ancestor–\ndescendant relationships in 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 change when the edge is moved, so 𝑑𝑒𝑜𝑙𝑑(𝑣) ∩\n𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝= 𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤(𝑣) ∩𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝.  \nIf 𝑢∈𝑑𝑒𝑜𝑙𝑑(𝑣) ∩𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝, then in the old graph there must be a directed path \n(𝑣, … , 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟, … , 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑, … , 𝑢). Here it is possible for any of \nthe ellipses to signify no nodes (for example, if 𝑣= 𝑝𝑎(𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟) then the first \nellipsis disappears); it is even possible that 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟= 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 or \n𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑= 𝑢, in which case the path “collapses” in the obvious way; but it is not \npossible that 𝑣= 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟. By Proposition 9.3 there is a directed path from \n𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟 to 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡, and by Proposition 9.7 there is a directed path in the \nnew graph from 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 to 𝑢. So in the new graph there is a directed path \n(𝑣, … 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟, … , 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑, … , 𝑢), in which similar “collapsings” \nare possible. The existence of this path shows that 𝑢∈𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤(𝑣) ∩𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝. A \nsimilar argument shows the converse, that if 𝑢∈𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤(𝑣) ∩𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 then 𝑢∈\n𝑑𝑒𝑜𝑙𝑑(𝑣) ∩𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝. \nTherefore 𝑑𝑒𝑜𝑙𝑑(𝑣) ∩𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝= 𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤(𝑣) ∩𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔- \n𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝. Putting this together with 𝑑𝑒𝑜𝑙𝑑(𝑣) ∩𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝= 𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤(𝑣) ∩𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 shows \nthat 𝑑𝑒𝑜𝑙𝑑(𝑣) = 𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤(𝑣).   \n\n9 Local moves in forests and trees \n \n 88 \nProposition 9.9. In 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝, the only nodes whose weights can possibly change are \nthe ones on the path between 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 and 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑.  \nProof. The nodes that are not on the path between 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 and 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 are all on the \nends of arrows that emanate from nodes on that path, or in tree structures on the ends \nof these arrows. The descendants of these nodes consist entirely of other nodes in these \ntree structures, and these sets of descendants do not change when the edge is moved.   \nFor an illustration of Propositions 9.8 and 9.9, see Figure 9.4, in which 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 is \nthe right part of the two graphs and the nodes that are not on the paths mentioned in \nthe propositions are white.  \nProposition 9.10. The weight of 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 changes to |𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝|. For the other \nnodes on the path from 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 to 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑, the weight changes to |𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝| −𝑥, \nwhere 𝑥 is the original weight of the previous node on this path.  \nProof. After the edge-move there is an edge from 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 to 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑. So all the \nother nodes in 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 must be descendants of 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑, and the weight of \n𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 is therefore |𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝|. Next consider a node 𝑣 on the path from \n𝑛𝑒𝑤𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 to 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 (for example 𝑣= ❼ in Figure 9.4). After the edge-directions are \nupdated, the edge going into 𝑣 comes from the previous node on this path (in this case, \n⓭). So the descendants of 𝑣 consist of all the nodes in 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 except for 𝑣 itself \nand the nodes on the other side of this edge. The number of nodes on the other side of \nthe edge is the original weight of the previous node on the path; call this 𝑥. So the new \nweight of 𝑣 is |𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝| −𝑥.   \nTo describe the updates for the nodes on the path between 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 and 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡, \nit is necessary to split this path into two parts. As before, let 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟 be the \nyoungest common ancestor of 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 and 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡. (Figure 9.5 shows the eight \npossibilities for the relative positions of these nodes; the arguments hold in all cases.) \nConsider separately the path from 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 to 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟 and the path from \n𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 to 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟.  \nDefinition 9.11. If the path between 𝑢 and 𝑣 is (𝑢, 𝑢1, … , 𝑢𝑘, 𝑣), then the path from 𝑢 to \n“just before” 𝑣 is (𝑢, 𝑢1, … , 𝑢𝑘). If 𝑘= 1 then this is (𝑢, 𝑢1), if the path between 𝑢 and 𝑣 \nis just (𝑢, 𝑣) then it is (𝑢), and if 𝑢= 𝑣 then it is ∅.  \nProposition 9.12. For the nodes on the path from 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 to just before \n𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟, the weight increases by |𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝|.  \nProof. Consider a node 𝑣 on this path (for example, 𝑣= ⓮ in Figure 9.4). The nodes in \n𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 are not descendants of 𝑣 before the move, but they are after. So the weight \nof 𝑣 increases by |𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝|.  \nProposition 9.13. For the nodes on the path from 𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 to just before \n𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟, the weight decreases by |𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝|. \nProof. Consider a node 𝑣 on this path (for example, 𝑣= ❻ in Figure 9.4). The nodes in \n𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝 are descendants of 𝑣 before the move, but not after. So the weight of 𝑣 \ndecreases by |𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝|.  \nProposition 9.14. The weight of 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐴𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟 does not change.  \n\n \n9.4 The system for storing a tree \n \n89 \nProof.

They are sequences of length 𝑝−2 whose elements are \nthe labels of the nodes (or, equivalently, integers in {1, … , 𝑝}). There is a one-to-one \ncorrespondence between all the possible trees on 𝑝 nodes and all the possible Prüfer \nsequences, and there are algorithms for working out the Prüfer sequence from the tree \nand vice versa. The one-to-one correspondence trivially implies Cayley’s formula for the \nnumber of trees on 𝑝 labelled nodes, 𝑝𝑝−2 (Cayley 1889). Changing one letter in the \nPrüfer sequence does not correspond to anything so simple as moving one edge in the \ngraph, so it does not seem sensible to use Prüfer sequences for the present purpose.  \n \n\n \n94 \n10 \nAlgorithms for exploring the \nposterior distribution  \n10.1 Adaptations of two algorithms  \nPreamble \nIn Bayesian structure-learning for GGMs restricted to forests or trees, if there are 15 or \nmore nodes then there are still too many graphs for it to be possible to analyze all of \nthem. Instead the posterior distribution has to be approximated in some way (as \nmentioned in “Exploring the posterior distribution” in section 3.1). This section \ndescribes two ways of doing this.  \nReversible-jump MCMC for structure-learning \nOne way to approximate the posterior distribution is reversible-jump MCMC, based on \nthe method for decomposable graphs described in Giudici & Green (1999). This and the \nnext two subsections describe how this method can be adapted for forests or trees. \nMuch of this is closely based on section 3.2 of Giudici & Green (1999), and most of the \nnotation is the same. If 𝑀 is a matrix, then 𝑀𝐴 means the submatrix of 𝑀 that consists of \nthe rows and columns indexed by the elements of 𝐴.  \nThe standard Metropolis–Hastings algorithm creates a Markov chain whose distri-\nbution converges to a given invariant distribution; values from this Markov chain are \nused as an approximate sample from the distribution. Reversible-jump MCMC is similar, \nbut the dimension of the state-space can change from one step to the next, so a more \ncomplicated formula has to be used for the acceptance probability. Reversible-jump \nMCMC is mostly used for approximating posterior distributions that include models of \nseveral different dimensions.  \nThe formula for the acceptance probability in reversible-jump MCMC is equation (7) in \nGreen (1995). It is somewhat complicated, so I will give the formula for the special case \nof proposing a move to a higher-dimensional variable. Let the variable be 𝑦 and the \ndesired invariant distribution be 𝜋(𝑦), and suppose that the proposed move is from 𝑦 to \n𝑦′, which has higher dimension. Sample 𝑢 from a distribution with density 𝑞 and let 𝑦′ \n= 𝑦′(𝑦, 𝑢) be an invertible deterministic function. The move is accepted with probability  \n𝛼(𝑦, 𝑦′) = min{1, 𝜋(𝑦′)\n𝜋(𝑦) ×\n𝑟(𝑦′)\n𝑟(𝑦)𝑞(𝑢) × | 𝜕𝑦′\n𝜕(𝑦, 𝑢)|} . \n \n               ↑ \n𝑇= ratio of  \ntarget densities \n          ↑ \n𝑃= proposal \nratio \n       ↑ \nJacobian \n\n \n10.1 Adaptations of two algorithms \n \n95 \nHere 𝑟(𝑦) is the probability of choosing this type of move, starting from 𝑦. This formula \nensures that the Markov chain satisfies detailed balance and its distribution converges \nto 𝜋.  \nGiudici & Green (1999) explain how to use reversible-jump MCMC to create an approxi-\nmate sample from the posterior distribution in Bayesian structure-learning of GGMs, for \ndecomposable graphs, using the HIW prior distribution for Σ. In the next two \nsubsections I describe adaptations of this algorithm for forests and trees, respectively, \nand show how the formulas for the various acceptance probabilities can be derived \nfrom general formulas. These adapted algorithms produce an approximate sample from \nthe posterior distribution of 𝑦= (𝐺, Γ), where 𝐺 is the graph and Γ is the incomplete \ncovariance matrix. Γ only contains the elements that correspond to edges in 𝐺; the \nother elements are blank. (See Giudici & Green 1999 for why it is convenient to use Γ \nrather than Σ or Σ−1.)  \nThe dimension of Γ is the same as the number of edges in 𝐺. In the case of trees, the \ndimension of Γ always stays the same but the positions of its elements change when 𝐺 \nchanges, so reversible-jump MCMC is still appropriate. The main object of interest is the \nposterior distribution of 𝐺, which is simply the marginal distribution of 𝐺.  \nThe MCMC for forests repeatedly performs the following two types of move:  \n(a) add or delete an edge from 𝐺 (this also requires changes to Γ),  \n(b) change all the elements of Γ.  \nThe MCMC for trees is the same except that, instead of adding or deleting an edge from \n𝐺, it moves an edge from one position to another.  \nGiudici & Green (1999) use a slightly more elaborate algorithm, with a hierarchical \nprior for the HIW parameters 𝛿 and 𝐷. Their variable is 𝑦= (𝐺, Γ, 𝛿, 𝐷), and they have \ntwo further move-types, for updating 𝛿 and 𝐷.  \nMCMC on forests \nMCMC on forests, which I will call McmcF, is a simplified version of MCMC on \ndecomposable graphs. For move-type (a), the proposal is to update 𝑦= (𝐺, Γ) to 𝑦′ =\n(𝐺′, Γ′), where 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸) and 𝐺′ = (𝑉, 𝐸′). The edge to add or remove, (𝑣𝑖, 𝑣𝑗), is \nchosen uniformly at random from the edges that can be added or removed.  \nAdding an edge  \nFirst consider the case where the edge is to be added, so that 𝐸′ = 𝐸∪(𝑣𝑖, 𝑣𝑗). The \nformula for the acceptance probability can be derived from the formula in the previous \nsubsection. Firstly consider the ratio of the target densities, which I will call 𝑇𝑑\n+. (Here 𝑑 \nmeans “decomposable graphs” and + means “adding an edge”; I will use similar \nnotations for other quantities and other types of move.) This is  \n𝑇𝑑\n+ = 𝜋(𝑦′)\n𝜋(𝑦) =\nℎ(Σ𝑆)ℎ(Σ𝑆∪{𝑖,𝑗}\n′\n)\nℎ(Σ𝑆∪{𝑖})ℎ(Σ𝑆∪{𝑗}) , \n\n10 Algorithms for exploring the posterior distribution \n \n 96 \nwhere 𝑆 is a separator on the path between cliques that contain 𝑖 and 𝑗, and ℎ(Σ𝐴) =\n𝐼𝑊(Σ𝐴; 𝛿, 𝐷𝐴) × 𝑁(𝑥𝐴, Σ𝐴). Here 𝐼𝑊 is the inverse-Wishart density and 𝑁 is the multi-\nvariate Gaussian likelihood.  \nIn a forest, (𝑣𝑖, 𝑣𝑗) can only be added if 𝑣𝑖 and 𝑣𝑗 are in different components. It follows \nthat 𝑆= ∅ and the ratio simplifies to  \n𝑇𝑓\n+ =\nℎ(Σ𝑖𝑗\n′ )\nℎ(Σ𝑖)ℎ(Σ𝑗) . \nCalculating ℎ(Σ𝑖) and ℎ(Σ𝑗) involves the one-dimensional inverse-Wishart distribution \n𝐼𝑊(𝜎; 𝛿, 𝐷), which is the same as the inverse-gamma distribution with parameters 𝛿/2 \nand 𝐷/2.  \nThe next part of the formula is 𝑃, the proposal ratio: \n𝑃𝑓\n+ =\n𝑟−(𝑦′)\n𝑟+(𝑦)𝑞(𝑢) . \nHere 𝑟+(𝑦) is the probability of choosing this particular move, which is  \n𝑟+(𝑦) =\n1\n|𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔𝐺| + |𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒𝐺| , \nwhere 𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔𝐺 is the number of existing edges in 𝐺 and 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒𝐺 is the number of \naddable edges in 𝐺; 𝑟−(𝑦′) is the probability of choosing the reverse move, from 𝐺′ to 𝐺. \nTo calculate 𝑟−(𝑦′), let 𝐼 be the component in 𝐺 that contains 𝑣𝑖 and let 𝐽 be the compo-\nnent that contains 𝑣𝑗. Compared to 𝐺, 𝐺′ has one more existing edge and |𝐼||𝐽| fewer \naddable edges, so  \n𝑟−(𝑦′) =\n1\n|𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔𝐺| + 1 + |𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒𝐺| −|𝐼||𝐽| . \nAs with decomposable graphs, Γ is updated to Γ′ by adding a new element in positions \n(𝑖, 𝑗) and (𝑗, 𝑖). The new element is 𝛾𝑖𝑗\n′ = 𝑢, and this is drawn from a zero-mean \nGaussian distribution with variance 𝜎𝐺\n2, so  \n𝑞(𝑢) =\n1\n𝜎𝐺√2𝜋\nexp (−𝑢2\n2𝜎𝐺\n2) . \nThe variance 𝜎𝐺\n2 is chosen by the user. The last part of the formula for the acceptance \nprobability is the Jacobian. As with decomposable graphs, this is 1, because the new \nparameter 𝑢 is used with no transformation (Giudici & Green 1999, Green 2003). The \nacceptance probability is therefore just  \nmin{1, 𝑇𝑓\n+𝑃𝑓\n+} . \nIf the graph prior distribution is not uniform, then 𝑇𝑓\n+ needs to be multiplied by \n𝑝(𝐺′)/𝑝(𝐺), where 𝑝(𝐺) is the prior probability of 𝐺. The same is true in the \nsubsequent cases (for 𝑇𝑓\n− and 𝑇𝑡).  \n\n \n10.1 Adaptations of two algorithms \n \n97 \nRemoving an edge \nIf the edge is to be removed, then 𝐸′ = 𝐸∖(𝑣𝑖, 𝑣𝑗). For decomposable graphs, the ratio \nof the target distributions is  \n𝑇𝑑\n−= 𝜋(y)\n𝜋(𝑦′) =\nℎ(Σ𝑆∪{𝑖})ℎ(Σ𝑆∪{𝑗})\nℎ(Σ𝑆)ℎ(Σ𝑆∪{𝑖,𝑗}\n′\n)  , \nwhich is just 1/𝑇𝑑\n+. Similarly, for forests the ratio is 𝑇𝑓\n−= 1/𝑇𝑓\n+.  \nThe proposal ratio is  \n𝑃𝑓\n−= 𝑟+(𝑦′)𝑞(𝑢)\n𝑟−(𝑦)\n . \n(There is a 𝑞 in the numerator and not in the denominator because the dimension is \nbeing decreased; this follows from equation (7) in Green 1995.) Here 𝑟−(𝑦) is the \nprobability of choosing this move. This is the same as 𝑟+(𝑦), which is given above. To \ncalculate 𝑟+(𝑦′), let 𝐼 be the component in 𝐺′ that contains 𝑣𝑖 and let 𝐽 be the \ncomponent that contains 𝑣𝑗. Compared to 𝐺, 𝐺′ has one less existing edge and |𝐼||𝐽| \nmore addable edges, so the probability of the reverse move is  \n𝑟+(𝑦′) =\n1\n|𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔𝐺| −1 + |𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒𝐺| + |𝐼||𝐽| . \nΓ is updated by removing its (𝑖, 𝑗) and (𝑗, 𝑖) elements; 𝑢= 𝛾𝑖𝑗 and 𝑞 is as above. The \nJacobian is 1 and the acceptance probability is  \nmin{1, 𝑇𝑓\n−𝑃𝑓\n−} . \nUpdating the incomplete covariance matrix \nMove-type (b), the update of Γ, is exactly as in Giudici & Green (1999). Each element is \nperturbed by adding a zero-mean Gaussian random variable with variance 𝜎𝑖𝑗\n2. In \nsymbols,  \n𝛾𝑖𝑗\n′  ~ 𝑁(𝛾𝑖𝑗, 𝜎𝑖𝑗\n2). \nHere 𝜎𝑖𝑗 is a single value, chosen by the user, though it could be a different value for \neach pair (𝑖, 𝑗). This is not a dimension-changing move, so the appropriate acceptance \nprobability can be found using the formula for the standard Metropolis–Hastings \nalgorithm. It consists of two factors. The first is the ratio of the target distributions, \nwhich is  \n𝑇𝑓\nΓ = 𝐻𝐼𝑊( Σ′ ∣𝛿, 𝐷, 𝐺)𝑁( 𝑥∣Σ′, 𝐺)\n𝐻𝐼𝑊( Σ ∣𝛿, 𝐷, 𝐺)𝑁( 𝑥∣Σ, 𝐺)  . \n𝐻𝐼𝑊 is the HIW density and 𝑁 is the multivariate Gaussian likelihood. The second \nfactor is the ratio of the proposal distributions. This is 1 since the proposal distribution \nis symmetric. The acceptance probability is therefore min{1, 𝑇𝑓\nΓ}.  \n\n10 Algorithms for exploring the posterior distribution \n \n 98 \nMCMC on trees \nI will call this McmcT.  \nUpdating the graph \nUpdating a tree by moving an edge requires removing one element from Γ and inserting \na different element. The dimension of the parameter space stays the same, but the \nmeaning of the parameters changes. The formula for the acceptance probability can be \nderived from the formula for general reversible-jump MCMC.  \nFirst consider move-type (a). Suppose the proposed update to the graph is to move the \nedge (𝑣𝑖, 𝑣𝑗) to (𝑣𝑘, 𝑣𝑙), so that 𝐸′ = 𝐸∪(𝑣𝑘, 𝑣𝑙) ∖(𝑣𝑖, 𝑣𝑗) . The ratio of the target \ndensities is  \n𝑇𝑡=\nℎ(Σ𝑘𝑙)\nℎ(Σ𝑘)ℎ(Σ𝑙) × ℎ(Σ𝑖)ℎ(Σ𝑗)\nℎ(Σ𝑖𝑗)\n , \nwhere ℎ(Σ𝐴) is as for forests.  \nThe proposal ratio is  \n𝑃𝑡= 𝑟(𝑦′)\n 𝑟(𝑦) × 𝑞(𝛾𝑖𝑗)\n𝑞(𝛾𝑘𝑙\n′ ) . \nThe factors in this will be explained in turn. Firstly, 𝑟(𝑦) is the probability of the current \nmove, which is 1/𝑚(𝐺), where 𝑚(𝐺) is the number of possible moves from 𝐺; 𝑟(𝑦′) is \nthe probability of the reverse move, which is 1/𝑚(𝐺′). Assume the edge-move is chosen \nuniformly at random from among all the possible edge-moves, as described in section \n9.4, and 𝑣1 is the root. If the current graph is 𝐺, then the number of possible moves is  \n𝑚(𝐺) = ∑[𝑊(𝑣𝑧)(𝑝−𝑊(𝑣𝑧))]\n𝑝\n𝑧=2\n, \nwhere 𝑊(𝑣) = |𝑑𝑒(𝑣)| + 1. The values of 𝑚(𝐺) and 𝑚(𝐺′) can be calculated when they \nare needed. Alternatively, 𝑚(𝐺′) can mostly be calculated from 𝑚(𝐺)—most of the \nvalues in the sum for 𝑚(𝐺′) are the same as the values in the sum for 𝑚(𝐺), since the \nonly nodes whose weights change are the ones on two particular paths (see section 9.4). \nAs for forests, the incomplete covariance matrix Γ is updated by removing 𝛾𝑖𝑗 and \ninserting 𝛾𝑘𝑙\n′ , which is drawn from 𝑁(0, 𝜎𝐺\n2), whose density is 𝑞.  \nThe Jacobian is 1. Putting all these together, the acceptance probability is min{1, 𝑇𝑡𝑃𝑡} .  \nThe simplest alternative to choosing edge-moves uniformly at random is to choose an \nedge uniformly at random, then remove it, then reinsert it uniformly at random. \nSuppose the components that result from removing the edge are 𝐼 and 𝐽. The proba-\nbility of choosing that edge to remove is 1/(𝑝−1), and the probability of putting it back \nin any particular position is 1/(|𝐼||𝐽| −1), so the probability of any particular move is  \n1\n𝑝−1 ×\n1\n|𝐼||𝐽| −1 . \n\n \n10.1 Adaptations of two algorithms \n \n99 \nThe probability of the reverse move is the same, so these two elements cancel out, and \nthe proposal ratio is just 𝑞(𝛾𝑖𝑗)/𝑞(𝛾𝑘𝑙\n′ ).  \nUpdating the incomplete covariance matrix \nThe update of Γ is the same as in the case of forests.  \nStochastic shotgun search on forests and trees \nAn alternative to MCMC is the shotgun stochastic search algorithm that appears in \nsection 6 of Jones et al (2005). This algorithm moves around in the space of possible \ngraphs, calculating the unnormalized posterior probability of the graphs that it visits \nand some of their neighbours, and usually moving towards graphs with higher proba-\nbility. It does not involve a Markov chain and it does not give an approximation to the \nposterior distribution of Σ. Below is a version of this algorithm that has been adapted \nfor forests or trees. I call the version for forests SSSF and the version for trees SSST.  \n1. Start with a forest/tree 𝐺, and calculate and store its unnormalized posterior proba-\nbility.  \n2. Choose 𝜔 distinct moves from 𝐺. (For forests a move consists of adding or removing \nan edge, and for trees it consists of moving an edge. Use the algorithms in section \n9.3 for forests and section 9.4 for trees.)  \n3. Calculate and store the unnormalized posterior probabilities of the 𝜔 neighbouring \nforests/trees that result from doing these moves (except in the case of graphs for \nwhich this has previously been done).  \n4. Select one of the 𝜔 neighbouring graphs by choosing each with probability propor-\ntional to its unnormalized posterior probability, and set 𝐺 to be this graph.  \n5. Go back to step 2 and repeat many times. (Either stop after a fixed amount of time \nor after a fixed number of iterations.)  \nThe unnormalized posterior distribution is taken to be the values that were calculated \nfor the graphs whose probabilities were calculated, and zero for all other graphs. The \nalgorithm is intended as a simple alternative to MCMC with the possible advantage that \nit always moves to a new graph at every iteration, so it cannot get stuck at a single \ngraph. It simply explores the space of possible graphs, finding their unnormalized \nposterior probabilities, and tends to move towards graphs that have higher proba-\nbilities. It sometimes moves to graphs of lower probability, so it is not just deterministic \ngreedy hill-climbing. Any particular route through all the possible graphs has positive \nprobability, so if run for enough time it will eventually visit all the graphs. In this trivial \nsense it asymptotically gives the true posterior distribution.  \nAs well as the restriction to forests or trees, the above algorithm is different from the \noriginal one in Jones et al (2005) in three other ways. Firstly, in the original algorithm, \nat step 3 only the top 𝑥2 neighbouring graphs are retained. Secondly, at step 4 the neigh-\nbouring graph 𝐺𝑖 is chosen with probability proportional to 𝑝𝑖\n𝛼, where 𝑝𝑖 is its \nunnormalized posterior probability and 𝛼 is a positive annealing parameter. (As 𝛼→∞ \nthe original algorithm becomes deterministic greedy hill-climbing.) Thirdly, at step 5 \nonly a list of the top 𝑥3 graphs is stored. Of these three differences, the third is the most \nlikely to be useful, since storing all the graphs takes a lot of memory.  \n\n10 Algorithms for exploring the posterior distribution \n \n \n100 \nThe experiments in sections 7 and 8 of Jones et al (2005) use 𝛼= 1 and 𝑥2 = 𝜔, which \nmake their algorithm similar to the one given above. They also set 𝜔 to be the number \nof neighbouring graphs, so the algorithm calculates the unnormalized posterior \nprobabilities of all the neighbouring graphs, not just some of them. (The set of all the \nneighbouring graphs consists of all the graphs that can be made by making a single \nmove from the present graph.) If all the neighbouring graphs are analyzed, then in step \n2 there is no need to choose moves at random, uniformly or otherwise. In the case of \ntrees, this would mean that the node-weights are not needed. \nWith trees and large 𝑝, the number of neighbouring graphs is huge, as shown in Table \n10.1, so if all of them are analyzed it would take a long time to do even one iteration of \nSSST. For this reason I use the version where only some of the neighbouring graphs are \nchecked at each iteration.  \nJones et al (2005) say their algorithm is designed for distributed implementation \n(which means using multiple computers at once), and that “distributed computation is \nessential to the development of search and constructive methods beyond moderate \ndimensions.” Scott & Carvalho (2008) imply that using distributed computing is the \nmain purpose of Jones et al (2005)’s algorithm. Certainly, step 3 can be parallelized in \nan obvious way. But my programs to implement my versions of their algorithm are \nserial, not parallel, and they give reasonable results in a short amount of time (see the \nexperiments in chapter 11).  \n \nGraph \n \n𝑝= 100 \n \n𝑝= 1000 \n \nstar \nchain \n \nstar \nchain \nNumber of neighbours \n/ possible edge-moves \n \n9 801 \n998 001 \n \n166 650 \n166 666 500 \nTable 10.1. The number of neighbouring graphs (equivalently, the number of possible edge-\nmoves) within the space of trees, for four selected graphs. “Star” and “chain” are defined in \nsection 11.1 and the values were calculated using Propositions 11.4 and 11.5.  \n \nHow to store decomposable graphs \nIn section 11.7, SSSF and SSST are compared with the stochastic shotgun search algo-\nrithm on decomposable graphs. My programs for these experiments store and mani-\npulate decomposable graphs in basically the same way as Giudici & Green (1999) and \nJones et al (2005)—see also Jones et al (2004), which is a longer version. Full details \nare in section 3.1 and the appendix of Giudici & Green (1999) and section 2.1 of Green \n& Thomas (2013). Here I will just give aspects that are specific to my programs.  \nMy programs store decomposable graphs as junction trees and manipulate them by \nadding or removing any edge that can be added or removed, as in Giudici & Green \n(1999). If the proposed edge is not in the graph and the closest two cliques that contain \nthe two nodes are not neighbours in the junction tree, then the junction tree is \nmanipulated to make the two cliques be neighbours, as described in the second-last \nparagraph of Giudici & Green (1999).  \n\n \n10.2 Analyzing posterior graph distributions and assessing algorithms \n \n101 \nUsing junction trees, rather than junction forests, has the advantage that adding an edge \nbetween two separate components does not need to be treated separately, since it is a \nspecial case of the move shown by the downwards arrow in Figure 3(d) of Green & \nThomas (2013). It also means that separators are sometimes empty.  \n10.2 Analyzing posterior graph distributions and assessing \nalgorithms  \nHow frequentist algorithms are evaluated  \nFrequentist algorithms for graphical model structure-learning produce a single graph. \n(See section 3.2.) If the true graph is known, the natural way to measure how well one \nof these algorithms does is to compare the graph produced by the algorithm with the \ntrue graph. There are two scenarios in which you would know the true graph. One is \nthat you used simulated data that was generated from a distribution that corresponds \nto this graph. The other is that the data corresponds to objects that have been analyzed \nusing non-statistical methods, and a supposedly true graph-structure has been deduced \nfrom this analysis. The latter scenario is sometimes the case with networks of gene or \nprotein interaction—see for example Albieri (2010).  \nProbably the simplest ways to measure the success of a frequentist algorithm are the \nnumbers of true-positives, false-positives, false-negatives, and true-negatives. Table \n10.2 shows the meanings of these phrases.  \n \n \n \nTrue graph \n \n \nEdge \nNon-edge \nGraph produced by  \nthe algorithm \nEdge \ntrue-positive \nfalse-positive \nNon-edge \nfalse-negative \ntrue-negative \nTable 10.2. The meanings of “true-positive” and related phrases, for a single graph produced by \na frequentist algorithm. For example, a true-positive is an edge that is in both the true graph and \nthe graph produced by the algorithm.  \n \nTrue-positives and the other three quantities are not specific to graphs or graphical \nmodel structure-learning. They can be used with any type of binary classification, for \nexample frequentist statistical hypothesis tests or medical tests to diagnose whether a \nperson has a disease—a test is reliable if it seldom gives false-positives or false-\nnegatives.  \nAlso used are several ratios (Albieri 2010, page 50). In the following, 𝑇𝑃 stands for the \nnumber of true-positives, and the other abbreviations are similar:  \n \n \n \nprecision = \n𝑇𝑃\n𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑃 \n \n \n \ntrue-positive rate = recall = sensitivity = \n𝑇𝑃\n𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑁 \n \n \n \ntrue-negative rate = specificity = \n𝑇𝑁\n𝑇𝑁+𝐹𝑃 \n\n10 Algorithms for exploring the posterior distribution \n \n \n102 \n \n \n \nfalse-positive rate = \n𝐹𝑃\n𝑇𝑁+𝐹𝑃 \n \n \n \nfalse-negative rate = \n𝐹𝑁\n𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑁 \n \n \n \naccuracy = \n𝑇𝑃+𝑇𝑁\n𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑁+𝐹𝑃+𝑇𝑁 \n \n \n \nerror rate = \n𝐹𝑃+𝐹𝑁\n𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑁+𝐹𝑃+𝑇𝑁 \nFor example, the true-positive rate is the proportion of edges in the true graph that \nwere correctly identified by the algorithm. Probably the most-used rates are the first \nthree. For these, higher values are better.  \nMany frequentist algorithms have a tuning parameter. Varying this and repeating the \nalgorithm gives different values of the rates. An algorithm can be assessed by plotting \nthe precision (on the vertical axis) against the recall, for different values of the tuning \nparameter. Alternatively it can be assessed by plotting the recall against the false-\npositive rate—this is called a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. For \nexamples see Albieri (2010) or Guo et al (2011).  \nSome algorithms for estimating multivariate Gaussian distributions produce an \nestimate of the covariance matrix. This can be assessed using measures such as entropy \nloss and Frobenius loss (Guo et al 2011). Some research on estimating these distri-\nbutions talks only about the covariance matrix and does not mention graphs at all \n(though Dempster 1972, for example, does have elements of the precision matrix set to \nexactly zero).  \nAll these methods can be used either to compare different algorithms or to compare \ndifferent parameters in the same algorithm. For ways of evaluating algorithms for \ndirected acyclic graphical models, see Gasse et al (2012).  \nFrequentist and Bayesian algorithms can also be assessed by using the estimated \ngraphs or covariance matrices they produce to make predictions. These predictions can \nbe compared with reality or with other data that were not used by the algorithm. But \nmaking predictions is a different goal from learning the structure.  \nHow Bayesian methods are evaluated \nAssessing a Bayesian method is more complicated than assessing a frequentist method, \nbecause the former produces a graph distribution rather than a single graph. In this \nsection I will refer to the posterior probability that an edge is present in the graph as \nthe probability of that edge. This is sometimes called an edge-inclusion probability.  \nOne way to evaluate a Bayesian method is to use the MAP graph, and see for example \nhow many true-positives it has. But a single graph is rather simple given the large \namount of information in the posterior distribution. There is another drawback that is \neasiest to explain with an example. It might be the case that there are ten graphs that \nhave high probability, and the 2nd to 9th most likely graphs have many edges in \ncommon with each other but few edges in common with the most likely (MAP) graph. \nIn this case, if you are going to use a single graph, then it would probably be better to \n\n \n10.2 Analyzing posterior graph distributions and assessing algorithms \n \n103 \nuse the 2nd most likely graph, or the graph consisting of all edges whose probabilities \nare above a certain threshold, rather than the MAP graph.  \nAny of the algorithms described in section 10.1 produces an approximation to the graph \nposterior distribution, in the form of a set of graphs and estimates of their posterior \nprobabilities. The MTT-based methods described in chapter 8 do not produce the entire \nposterior distribution itself, or an approximation to it, but they can produce several \nexact quantities that can be used to compare algorithms.  \nAs with frequentist algorithms, there are two scenarios in which the true graph is \nknown. If the true graph is known, the simplest quantities with which to evaluate \nalgorithms are the expected number of true-positives and the expected values of the \nother quantities in Table 10.2.  \nBelow are listed the main objects or types of information that have been used in \nprevious research to summarize estimated graph posterior distributions for undirected \ngraphical models, or to evaluate the algorithms that produced these distributions.  \n• \nThe probabilities of all of the edges, in the form of a triangular matrix. The elements \nof the matrix are 𝑝𝑖𝑗= ℙ((𝑖, 𝑗) ∈𝐸∣𝑥). See Wang & Li (2012)’s example with six \nnodes or Dobra et al (2011)’s example with ten nodes. This seems to be the most \ncommonly used information.  \n• \nThe probabilities of all the edges, in the form of a diagonally symmetric square grid \nwhere the shade of grey in each little square indicates that edge’s probability. See \nWong et al (2003), Scott & Carvalho (2008), or Armstrong et al (2009). \n• \nThe probabilities of certain specific edges. See Jones et al (2005) or Carvalho & \nScott (2009).  \n• \nA graph consisting of all the edges whose probabilities are above a certain \nthreshold. See Wang & Li (2012)’s example with 100 nodes, where the threshold is \n½ and they call this object the “posterior mean graph”, or Armstrong et al (2009)’s \nexample with 11 nodes, where the threshold is 70%.  \n• \nThe top-ranking (most likely) graph or, less commonly, graphs. See Giudici & Green \n(1999) or Jones et al (2005).  \n• \nThe probabilities of the top-ranking graph or, less commonly, graphs. These may be \nnormalized or unnormalized. See Giudici & Green (1999), Jones et al (2005), or \nScott & Carvalho (2008). Scott & Carvalho (2008) judge their search algorithms by \nthe posterior probabilities of the models they find—the higher, the better. For each \nalgorithm they show the top 1000 posterior probabilities on a histogram.  \n• \nETPR (expected true-positive rate) and related quantities. Moghaddam et al (2009) \ngive a plot of 𝑇𝑃𝑅 against 𝐹𝑃𝑅 in which each graph appears as a single point, and \nthe expected values of these rates (under Bayesian model-averaging) is plotted as a \nsingle point in a different colour.  \nThese numbers or graphs are usually then commented on and discussed, and \nconclusions are reached about which algorithm, prior, or parameter is best.  \nMost of the objects listed above only convey separate information about each edge; they \ndo not show which combinations of edges are likely to be present. Consequently they \nfail to reveal certain notable features of the graph distribution. As an extreme and \n\n10 Algorithms for exploring the posterior distribution \n \n \n104 \nunlikely example, if the top few graphs were stars centred at different nodes (see \nDefinition 11.1), then the matrix of edge-probabilities would only show that all the \nedges in those stars were likely. It would not reveal that the graph was almost certainly \na star. Only the MAP graph and the other top-ranking graphs convey any information \nabout the graph as a whole, not just separate edges.  \nSection 2.4 mentioned the importance of hubs or stars. Albieri (2010) found that when \nthe true graph contains a star, frequentist algorithms mistakenly find that these nodes \nform a clique. In evaluating Bayesian methods it would be desirable to be able to notice \nany consistent structural “bias” such as this. The simplest way to judge whether stars \nare correctly identified would be to look at the posterior expected degrees of the hub \nand the nodes it is connected to. (If the entire true graph is a star, then the expected \ndegree of the hub is exactly the same as 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅.) In chapter 11, I evaluate various \nBayesian algorithms and priors using simulated datasets, but my main algorithms only \nconsider forests or trees, so there is no possibility of misidentifying a star as a clique.  \nFriedman et al (2000) use indicator functions for features of the graph. They work with \ndirected graphical models. The first type of features they consider is “Markov relations”, \nabout whether one node is in the Markov blanket of another (which holds if the two \nnodes are connected by an edge or share a child). The other is “order relations”, about \nwhether one node is an ancestor of another.  \nSingle numbers for evaluating Bayesian methods \nIn abbreviations hereafter, “E” means “expected”. It is useful to have a small number of \nnumerical quantities to evaluate how well a Bayesian method does, because these are \nordered and easier to interpret than large matrices or graphs. Possible quantities are \n𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅, the three quantities related to it, and the expected degrees of the nodes. The \nalgorithms in section 10.1 are random, so the estimates of 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅 and the other \nquantities will probably vary between different runs.  \nIf the Bayesian analysis is restricted to trees, then there are restrictions on 𝐸𝑇𝑃 and the \nthree related quantities. In particular, 𝐸𝑇𝑃+ 𝐸𝐹𝑃= 𝑝−1. If the true graph is also a \ntree, 𝐸𝑇𝑃+ 𝐸𝐹𝑁= 𝑝−1, so only one of the four quantities is worth looking at. If the \nanalysis is restricted to forests, then it may be useful to look at two values, for example \n𝐸𝑇𝑃 and 𝐸𝑇𝑁, but if all the high-ranking graphs are trees then 𝐸𝑇𝑃+ 𝐸𝑇𝑁 will be close \nto 𝑝−1.  \nIn the case of trees, the MTT-based methods from section 8.2 and 8.3 can be used to find \n𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅. I will use them for these purposes in section 11.5.  \nFormulas for evaluating Bayesian algorithms \nAs examples, I will give formulas for four quantities to do with the posterior graph \ndistribution: (a) the probability of any particular edge, (b) the degree of any particular \nnode, (c) 𝐸𝑇𝑃, and (d) 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅.  \nSuppose the true graph is 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸) and the graphs produced by the algorithm are \n{𝐺𝑖= (𝑉, 𝐸𝑖)}. In the case of the MTT-based method, this set contains all the possible \ntrees. Let  \n\n \n10.2 Analyzing posterior graph distributions and assessing algorithms \n \n105 \n𝕀𝐺𝑖\n(𝑢,𝑣) = { 1 if (𝑢, 𝑣) ∈𝐸𝑖\n0 otherwise.   \n(a) The posterior probability of edge (𝑢, 𝑣) is  \n∑𝑝( 𝐺𝑖∣∣𝑥)𝕀𝐺𝑖\n(𝑢,𝑣)\n𝑖\n . \nThis formula uses the normalized posterior probabilities of the graphs, so you have to \nadd all the unnormalized probabilities to find the normalizing constant (except in the \ncase of the MTT-based method, which calculates the normalizing constant without \nusing all the separate unnormalized probabilities).  \n(b) The expected degree of node 𝑣 is  \n∑(𝑝( 𝐺𝑖∣∣𝑥) ∑𝕀𝐺𝑖\n(𝑢,𝑣)\n𝑢≠𝑣\n)\n𝑖\n= ∑∑𝑝( 𝐺𝑖∣∣𝑥)𝕀𝐺𝑖\n(𝑢,𝑣)\n𝑢≠𝑣\n𝑖\n. \n(c) The number of true-positives in 𝐺𝑖 is  \n𝑇𝑃= ∑𝕀𝐺\n(𝑢,𝑣)𝕀𝐺𝑖\n(𝑢,𝑣)\n𝑢,𝑣∈𝑉\n , \nso  \n𝐸𝑇𝑃= ∑∑𝑝( 𝐺𝑖∣∣𝑥)𝕀𝐺\n(𝑢,𝑣)𝕀𝐺𝑖\n(𝑢,𝑣)\n𝑢,𝑣∈𝑉\n𝑖\n \n=\n∑\n∑𝑝( 𝐺𝑖∣∣𝑥)𝕀𝐺𝑖\n(𝑢,𝑣)\n𝑖\n(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸\n. \nThe second expression shows that 𝐸𝑇𝑃 is the sum of the posterior probabilities of all \nthe edges in the true graph.  \n(d) For 𝐺𝑖, 𝑇𝑃𝑅= 𝑇𝑃/|𝐸𝐺|. So 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅 is  \n𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅 = ∑∑𝑝( 𝐺𝑖∣∣𝑥)\n𝕀𝐺\n(𝑢,𝑣)𝕀𝐺𝑖\n(𝑢,𝑣)\n|𝐸𝐺|\n𝑢,𝑣∈𝑉\n𝑖\n= 𝐸𝑇𝑃\n|𝐸𝐺| , \nwhich lies between 0 and 1.  \nFor algorithms that produce an approximation to the entire posterior distribution, an \nalternative would be to calculate these values by only using the top 𝑁 most likely graphs, \nfor some 𝑁.  \nVisual representations of graph distributions  \nWhat is the best way to visually represent or summarize a graph posterior distribution? \nA single graph is too simple. A triangular or symmetric matrix of edge-probabilities \ncontains more information, but for eight or more nodes it is probably impossible to \nnotice any overall patterns. A square grid, with colours or shades representing the \nvalues in this matrix, works well if the graph has a strong structure, but if the nodes are \n\n10 Algorithms for exploring the posterior distribution \n \n \n106 \nin no particular order and the high-probability graphs have complicated structure then \nit may be hard to take in.  \nAnother possibility is a graph in which the thickness of each edge is proportional to its \nprobability, and only edges whose probabilities are greater than a certain threshold are \nshown. This would be easy to take in, because there is no need to peer at numbers or \ncount which column or row an entry is in. But it still only conveys separate information \nabout each edge.  \nThe best way of showing an entire graph distribution is an animation that consists of \ngraphs generated from it. I realized this when Peter Green said it during a talk in \nNovember 2012. Java programs that can show animations of the MCMC in Green & \nThomas (2013) are normally available from Alun Thomas’s JPSGCS website, at \nhttp://balance.med.utah.edu/wiki/index.php/JPSGCS, though as of February 2013 this \nis not working.  \nSupplementary notes: further details on evaluation of Bayesian methods  \nIt may be useful to give more detail about some of the papers that evaluate Bayesian \nmethods. Dobra et al (2011)’s example with ten nodes is about matrix-variate GGMs. As \nwell as the estimated edge probabilities they also give the standard errors of these \nestimated probabilities. One of their methods did very well, giving probability 1 to all \nthe edges in the true graph and less than 0.1 to all the edges that were not. Matrix-\nvariate distributions have two graphs; one of their true graphs had 𝑝= 5 and the other \nwas a loop with 𝑝= 10. Wang & Li (2012) found in one of their examples that all the \nedges in the true graph got probability 1 and all the other edges got probability below \n0.08. The true graph was a loop with 𝑝= 100.  \nCarvalho & Scott (2009) and Wang & Li (2012) evaluate their posterior distributions by \nusing them for prediction in mutual funds (schemes that pool money from many \ninvestors and invest it in stocks or other financial assets—see U.S. Securities and \nExchange Commission 2010). Moghaddam et al (2009) evaluate posterior distributions \nby using them for prediction, but I cannot understand whether they use all the graphs \nor just one of them.  \nGiudici & Green (1999) also give the expected number of edges under the posterior \ndistribution. Some algorithms produce estimates of the posterior distribution for the \ncovariance matrix. For how these can be assessed see Giudici & Green (1999) or Wong \net al (2003).  \nArmstrong et al (2009) compared their MCMC for GGM structure-learning to one in \nBrooks et al (2003). To do this they gave a Manhattan plot that showed the number of \nedges in the graph at each iteration and the cumulative number of graphs visited at \neach iteration. They also used effective sample sizes. All the methods in this section \n(10.2) can of course just as well be used for directed acyclic graphical models. See for \nexample Altomare et al (2011).  \n \n\n \n107 \n11 \nExperiments \n11.1 Facts about star and chain graphs \nThe subsequent sections of this chapter describe experiments on simulated data. Most \nof the datasets were generated from distributions that correspond to star and chain \ngraphs. The reasons for using these shapes of graph were that they are extremal in \ncertain senses, described by the three propositions in this section, to do with exploring \nthe space of trees by making local moves. To define these two types of graph, which are \nalso trees, let 𝑉= {𝑣1, … , 𝑣𝑝}.  \nDefinition 11.1. (𝑉, 𝐸) is a star if 𝐸= {{𝑣1, 𝑣𝑖}, … , {𝑣𝑖−1, 𝑣𝑖}, {𝑣𝑖+1, 𝑣𝑖}, … , {𝑣𝑝, 𝑣𝑖}} for \nsome 𝑖. (See also section 2.3.)  \nDefinition 11.2. (𝑉, 𝐸) is a chain if the nodes can be relabelled in such a way that 𝐸=\n{{𝑣1, 𝑣2}, {𝑣2, 𝑣3}, … , {𝑣𝑝−1, 𝑣𝑝}}.  \nThe weight of node 𝑣 is 𝑊(𝑣) = 1 + |𝑑𝑒(𝑣)|. The number of edge-moves that start with \nremoving {𝑣, 𝑝𝑎(𝑣)} is 𝑔(𝑊(𝑣)) = 𝑊(𝑣)(𝑝−𝑊(𝑣)), and the total number of edge-\nmoves is ∑\n𝑔(𝑊(𝑣))\n𝑣≠𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑡\n. In considering the number of possible edge-moves from \nstars and chains, the root can be chosen arbitrarily from among all the nodes since this \ndoes not affect the number of edge-moves.  \nProposition 11.3. Stars are the only trees where all the nodes are chosen with equal \nprobability in line 1 of Algorithm IX (section 9.4).  \nProof. Suppose there is a tree that contains a path of length 4 and that this tree’s edges \nwould be chosen with equal probability in line 1 of Algorithm IX. Regard the tree as a \nrooted tree with root 𝑟 at one end of this path. Call the subsequent nodes on the path 𝑣1, \n𝑣2, and 𝑣3—see Figure 11.1, in which other nodes are not shown. Now 𝑑𝑒(𝑣1) ⊃\n𝑑𝑒(𝑣2) ⊃𝑑𝑒(𝑣3), so 𝑊(𝑣1) > 𝑊(𝑣2) > 𝑊(𝑣3). These three nodes being chosen with \nequal probability means that 𝑔(𝑊(𝑣1)) = 𝑔(𝑊(𝑣2)) = 𝑔(𝑊(𝑣3)). But 𝑔 is a quadratic \nfunction, so it is impossible for three distinct values of 𝑥 to have the same value of 𝑔(𝑥). \nTherefore no such tree can exist. The only trees that contain no paths of length 4 are \nstars, which completes the proof.   \n \n \nFigure 11.1. A path of length 4.  \n \n\n11 Experiments \n \n \n108 \nProposition 11.4. A star with 𝑝 nodes has (𝑝−1)2 possible edge-moves, and this is the \nfewest of any tree with 𝑝 nodes.  \nProof. The value of 𝑔(𝑤) is minimized at 𝑤= 1 or 𝑝−1, and its minimum value is 𝑝−1. \nConsider a star with 𝑝 nodes and suppose that its root is the hub (the node at the centre \nof the star). All the other nodes have weight 1, so the total number of possible edge-\nmoves is (𝑝−1)2, which is the minimum.   \nProposition 11.5. A chain with 𝑝 nodes has (𝑝3 −𝑝)/6 possible edge-moves, and this is \nthe most of any tree with 𝑝 nodes.  \nProof. Regard the chain graph as a horizontal line, take the leftmost node to be the root, \nand number the nodes from left to right. The weight of the (𝑖+ 1)th node is 𝑝−𝑖, so the \ntotal number of possible edge-moves is  \n∑𝑔(𝑝−𝑖)\n𝑝−1\n𝑖=1\n= ∑(𝑝−𝑖)𝑖\n𝑝−1\n𝑖=1\n= 𝑝3 −𝑝\n6\n . \nTo show that this is the maximum, consider a tree that contains a node of degree 3 or \nmore. Let this node be the root, label its children 𝑣1, 𝑣2, 𝑣3, …, and let 𝑤1, 𝑤2, 𝑤3, … be \nthese children’s weights. Without loss of generality assume that 1 ≤𝑤1 ≤𝑤2 ≤𝑤3 ≤\n⋯≤𝑝−1. Now 𝑤1 + 𝑤2 + 𝑤3 + ⋯= 𝑝−1, because the left-hand side counts all the \nnodes in the graph except the root exactly once. It follows that 𝑤1 ≤(𝑝−1)/3 and 𝑤1 +\n𝑤2 ≤2(𝑝−1)/3. Because 𝑔(𝑥) is a quadratic function with peak at 𝑥= 𝑝/2, it must be \nthe case that 𝑔(𝑤1 + 𝑤2) > 𝑔(𝑤1).  \nThe number of edge-moves that start with the removal of (𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑡, 𝑣1) is 𝑔(𝑤1). Create a \nnew tree by deleting the edge (𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑡, 𝑣2) and replacing it with (𝑣1, 𝑣2). In the new tree \n𝑊(𝑣1) = 𝑤1 + 𝑤2, so the number of edge-moves that start with the removal of \n(𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑡, 𝑣1) is 𝑔(𝑤1 + 𝑤2) > 𝑔(𝑤1). For all other nodes 𝑣, 𝑊(𝑣) and hence 𝑔(𝑊(𝑣)) are \nthe same as in the original tree. So the new tree has more edge-moves than the old one.  \nIt follows that any tree with the largest possible number of edge-moves must have no \nnode of degree 3 or more. The only such trees are chains.   \nThe three propositions still hold if the “non-move” is excluded, so that 𝑔(𝑊(𝑣)) =\n𝑊(𝑣)(𝑝−𝑊(𝑣)) −1. The only differences are that in Proposition 11.4 the number of \nedge-moves is (𝑝−1)(𝑝−2) and in Proposition 11.5 it is (𝑝3 −7𝑝)/6 + 1.  \nIn trees with other shapes, individual nodes can be extremal. Let 𝑒= (𝑣, 𝑝𝑎(𝑣)). If 𝑣 or \n𝑝𝑎(𝑣) has degree 1, then 𝑔(𝑊(𝑣)) has its lowest possible value. If 𝑒 splits the tree as \nnearly as possible in half, so that 𝑊(𝑣) ∈{(𝑝−1)/2, 𝑝/2, (𝑝+ 1)/2}, then 𝑔(𝑊(𝑣)) has \nits highest possible value.  \n11.2 Experiments with systems for storing trees  \nDifferent systems for storing trees \nSection 9.4 describes a way of storing trees so that edge-moves can be chosen uniformly \nat random. I will call this System A. To assess System A it is desirable to compare it to \n\n \n11.2 Experiments with systems for storing trees \n \n109 \nother systems for storing trees and choosing edge-moves. Here I describe three other \nsystems. In all four, trees are stored as rooted trees, because this makes it easy to check \nwhether moves are legal. All four systems produce a set of 𝜔 distinct edge-moves. The \nsystems will subsequently be compared using SSST, with the non-move excluded.  \nSystem A (weights). Trees are stored and edge-moves are chosen as described in \nsection 9.4.  \nSystem B (unused weights). Edge-weights are stored but not used. To choose 𝜔 edge-\nmoves, first create a list 𝐿 that contains 𝑝−2 copies of each edge. Choose 𝜔 edges from \n𝐿 uniformly at random and put these in a list called 𝑀. These are the edges that are to \nbe removed (and obviously they are not necessarily distinct). For each distinct edge 𝑒 in \n𝑀, let 𝑚𝑒 be the number of times 𝑒 appears in 𝑀, identify the two components that \nresult when you remove 𝑒, and choose 𝑚𝑒 distinct places to reinsert it.  \nSystem C (no weights). No edge-weights are stored. Edge-moves are chosen as in \nSystem B.  \nSystem D (rejection). No edge-weights are stored. To choose 𝜔 edge-moves, repeat the \nfollowing as many times as necessary: choose an edge uniformly at random, remove it \nand identify the two components that result, choose where to reinsert it uniformly at \nrandom, and accept this edge-move if and only if it has not already been chosen.  \nSystem D has one drawback. If 𝜔 is large relative to the total number of possible edge-\nmoves, then it is likely that many edge-moves will be rejected and choosing 𝜔 different \nedge-moves will take a long time.  \nSystems B and C are designed to avoid this drawback. The number of edge-moves that \nstart with removing (𝑣, 𝑝𝑎(𝑣)) is 𝑔(𝑊(𝑣)) = 𝑊(𝑣)(𝑝−𝑊(𝑣)) −1 ≥𝑝−2, so for each \ndistinct edge 𝑒 in 𝐿 there are at least 𝑝−2 possible places where it can be reinserted. 𝐿 \ncontains 𝑝−2 copies of each edge, so however many copies of 𝑒 are chosen to be put in \n𝑀, there will certainly be enough possible places for it to be reinserted. There is never \nany need to reject and repeat. Systems B and C will not work if 𝜔> |𝐿| = (𝑝−1)(𝑝−\n2), but this does not matter unless you want to find more edge-moves than that.  \nThe only difference between Systems A and B is that System B does not use the weights \n(it does store and update them). So if using the weights, and choosing edge-moves \nuniformly at random, gives some advantage, then this should be evident by comparing \nthe results of experiments that use these two systems.  \nThe only difference between Systems B and C is that System B wastes time storing and \nupdating the node-weights. So System C should always do at least as well as System B. If \nstoring and updating the weights takes little time, then there should be little difference \nbetween Systems B and C.  \nDatasets \nTo compare the various algorithms and ways of storing trees, a large number of \nsimulated datasets were generated. The values of 𝑝 that were used were 30 and 100, \nand the values of 𝑛 (the number of data) were 50 and 500. For each value of 𝑝, two \ncovariance matrices were created, one corresponding to a star and the other corres-\n\n11 Experiments \n \n \n110 \nponding to a chain. The diagonal elements of the covariances were all 1 and the non-\nzero partial correlations were all 0.99/√𝑝−1; these two conditions, together with the \ngraph, specify the covariances completely. (The reason for using this formula is the \ninequality in section 2.3 about the partial correlations in stars.)  \nThe four covariance matrices and two values of 𝑛 give eight combinations of covariance \nmatrix and 𝑛, whose descriptions can be seen on the horizontal axes in Figure 11.2. If \njust a single dataset were generated for each of these, then these datasets might be \natypical and the results might fail to show the effects of the different systems for storing \ntrees (and the different shapes of graph and values of 𝑝 and 𝑛). For this reason, 500 \ndatasets were generated for each combination of covariance matrix and 𝑛, and the \nalgorithm was run on all of these. The datasets were all generated from zero-mean \nmultivariate Gaussian distributions.  \nStar and chain graphs were used because they are extremal in the senses described in \nsection 11.1. Suppose the true graph is a star. If at a certain point in SSST the current \ngraph is the true graph, then, by Proposition 11.3, System A is equally likely to choose \nany of the edges to move. Systems B–D always do this. It follows that all four systems \nwill choose edge-moves uniformly at random. If the current graph is not the true graph \nbut something similar to it, as will probably be the case most of the time, then Systems \nB–D will choose edge-moves almost uniformly at random. In contrast, when the true \ngraph is a chain, Systems B–D will often choose edge-moves with a distribution that is \nfar from uniform—for example, all chains contain nodes that have the lowest and \nhighest possible values of 𝑔(𝑊(𝑣)).  \nExperiments \nThe four systems were compared by using them with SSST, as described in section 10.1, \nand running the algorithm under the same computational conditions and for the same \namount of CPU time, with the same parameters. For the hyper inverse Wishart prior on \nΣ, the scalar hyperparameter 𝛿 was 3 and the matrix hyperparameter was 𝐼𝑝(𝛿+ 2) \n(see Jones et al 2005, the erratum listed in the references, and Donnet & Marin 2012). \nThe prior distribution on the graph structure was uniform on trees with 𝑝 vertices. For \nthese experiments 𝜔 was chosen to be 𝑝2/20 so that it scaled appropriately with the \nnumber of possible edge-moves; this means 𝜔= 45 in the cases where 𝑝= 30 and 𝜔=\n500 where 𝑝= 100. For each value of 𝑝, all runs were started at a fixed graph that was \ndifferent from either of the graphs that the data were generated from.  \nThe issue of how to evaluate Bayesian structure-learning was discussed in section 10.2. \nEach run of the algorithm was done for 20 seconds, and the following quantities were \nrecorded: \n• \nthe number of distinct graphs visited \n• \n𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅 \n• \nthe true-positive rate in the top graph \n• \nthe score of the top graph (its unnormalized log posterior probability) \n• \nthe sums of the scores of the top 10 graphs.  \n\n \n11.2 Experiments with systems for storing trees \n \n111 \nResults \nThe results are shown in Figure 11.2. Each bar-chart corresponds to one of the \nquantities in the bullet-list above. Each group of four bars corresponds to one \ncombination of covariance matrix and 𝑛, and within each group each bar corresponds \nto one system for storing trees. For all five bar-charts, larger values are better.  \nEach bar corresponds to 500 runs of the algorithm on the different datasets generated \nfrom the same distribution with the same 𝑛. The heights of the bars are the median \nvalues and the “whiskers” show the 25% and 75% quartiles.  \nTo assess the algorithm in the cases where the true graph was a star, it is also of interest \nto know the posterior expected degree of the node that was supposed to be the hub at \nthe centre of the star. But this is just 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅 multiplied by 𝑝−1, so the relative heights of \nthe bars would be the same as in the second bar-chart.  \nMost of the bar-charts show no difference between the four systems for storing trees, or \nonly tiny differences. The number of graphs visited varies somewhat. System A does \nbetter than the other systems on the datasets with 𝑝= 30, 𝑛= 500, and the true graph \na star. But with four of the sets of 500 datasets it does worse than Systems B or C. \nSystem D does very badly for two of the sets, which is notable as it is probably the most \nobvious and easy to program.  \nIt might be expected that the weights would make more difference for chains than for \nhubs, because of the extremal properties shown in section 11.1. The numbers of graphs \nvisited by System A are indeed more different for chains than for stars. But they are \nlower. However, the interquartile ranges sometimes overlap.  \nOverall System C does slightly better than System B, as expected, though there is a large \noverlap between the ranges. The last two bar-charts are of less interest, firstly because \nthey show no differences between the four systems, and secondly because in these bar-\ncharts it is not legitimate to compare quantities that correspond to different sets of \ndatasets (because scores for different sets of datasets have nothing to do with each \nother).  \nThe differences shown in the bar-charts between the four systems are minor, but the \ndifferences between the eight datasets are major. Unsurprisingly, the expected true-\npositive rates and the true-positive rates in the top graphs are much higher when 𝑛 is \nlarge, and lower when 𝑝 is large. Of the four combinations of 𝑛 and 𝑝, the only one with \n𝑛< 𝑝 is 𝑝= 100, 𝑛= 50. This had the worst results in terms of true-positive rates, \nwhich was to be expected. It seems that SSST gives better results with stars than with \nchains. Perhaps stars are easier to approximate by wrong trees than chains.  \nSummarizing results from 500 datasets in a single bar has the disadvantage that you \ncannot compare the four systems for any specific dataset. But in many cases the \n“whiskers” are close to the tops of the bars, showing that there is not too much \nvariation within each set of 500 datasets.  \n \n\n11 Experiments \n \n \n112 \n \n\n \n11.2 Experiments with systems for storing trees \n \n113 \n \nFigure 11.2 (previous page and this page). Comparison of four different systems for storing \ntrees in SSST. Each bar-chart shows one measure of how well the four systems did on eight sets \nof 500 datasets. The heights of the bars are the median values and the “whiskers” show the 25% \nand 75% quartiles.  \n \nVariation with single datasets \nSSST is a random algorithm, so even with a single dataset the results might vary from \none run to the next. Figure 11.3 shows how the values vary between different runs on \neight particular datasets. Almost all the “whiskers” are very close to the tops of the bars, \nshowing that there is little variation between runs.  \n\n11 Experiments \n \n \n114 \n \nFigure 11.3. The variation between different runs of SSST on eight datasets. These bar-charts \nshow the same things as Figure 11.2 except that each bar corresponds to 500 runs of the \nalgorithm on the same dataset.  \n \n\n \n11.3 Experiments with non-forests \n \n115 \nFalse-positives in chains \nThe measures in Figure 11.2 are mostly lower for chains than for stars. One question \nthat arises is whether there is some pattern to the high-probability graphs that are \nvisited when the true graph is a chain. For example, do they tend to have false-positive \nedges between nodes that are two apart in the true graph?  \nFigure 11.4 shows the expected proportions of false-positives that were of this type, for \nthe chain graphs, as produced by SSST. These proportions are all low, showing that \nthere was not much tendency to find these edges. This is somewhat surprising, since it \nmeans that graphs that link further-apart nodes have higher probabilities or are more \nlikely to be visited. On the other hand, the interquartile ranges are large.  \n \n \nFigure 11.4. Expected proportion of false-positives that link nodes that are two apart in the true \ngraph, for the chain graphs.  \n \n11.3 Experiments with non-forests  \nThe experiments in this section address the question of whether restricting attention to \ntrees gives reasonable results in the case that the true graph is not a tree or forest, but \nis locally tree-like (see section 6.2). I used SSST, with System A, on datasets generated \nfrom graphs that were generated from the second Erdős–Rényi model, where the \nnumber of edges is fixed. In this section I will call this model 𝐺(𝑝, 𝑀), where 𝑝 is the \nnumber of nodes and 𝑀 is the number of edges. Theorem 6.2 implies that these graphs \nshould have few short cycles and thus be locally tree-like.  \n\n11 Experiments \n \n \n116 \nFor these experiments, generating a dataset consists of randomly generating a graph, \nthen creating a covariance matrix, and finally generating from the multivariate Gaussian \ndistribution. To ensure that the graphs had some cycles, I chose 𝑀 to be greater than \n𝑝−1.  \nResults are shown in Figure 11.5, in the light grey bars. The first and second bars in \neach group correspond to stars and chains and are taken from Figure 11.2. These are \nshown for comparison. In the second bar-chart, the white bars show the true values of \n𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅 for the datasets that correspond to Erdős–Rényi graphs. These were calculated \nusing the MTT-based methods from chapter 8.  \nBecause the algorithm is restricted to trees, all the graphs in the posterior distribution \nhave 𝑝−1 edges. But the true graphs have 𝑀 edges, and 𝑀> 𝑝−1. So it is impossible \nfor any graph in the posterior distribution to achieve a true-positive rate greater than \n(𝑝−1)/𝑀. These maximum achievable true-positive rates are shown by thick lines in \nthe second and third bar-charts.  \nIn several cases the results for the Erdős–Rényi graphs are better than the results for \nthe chains. In all cases they are at least similar. Overall, the values are reasonably high. \nThis provides some evidence that the restriction to trees is acceptable for these locally \ntree-like Erdős–Rényi graphs.  \nSSST gives very similar values of 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅 to MTT for the datasets with 𝑝= 30, 𝑛= 500 \nand 𝑝= 100, 𝑛= 50. This means that SSST estimates 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅 very accurately in these \ncases. With the other datasets it somewhat overestimates 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅.  \n11.4 Experiments with MCMC on forests and trees \nAbout the experiments \nThe MCMC algorithms used in this section are McmcF, where only forests are \nconsidered, and McmcT, where only trees are considered. These are described in \nsection 10.1. The datasets were generated in the same way as the ones in section 11.1, \nand the values of 𝑝 and 𝑛 are stated below. McmcF and McmcT have two parameters \nthat can be set, 𝜎𝐺 and 𝜎𝑖𝑗. The former is used in the updates to the graph structure and \nthe latter is used in the updates to the covariance matrix.  \nThe findings of this section, in summary, are that McmcF usually fails to mix, and that \nMcmcT mixes but takes much longer than SSST to give useful results. First I will \ndescribe the experiments and then I will discuss the results.  \n \n\n \n11.4 Experiments with MCMC on forests and trees \n \n117 \n \nFigure 11.5. The light grey bars (the third bar in each group) show measures of how successful \nSSST is with non-forest graphs generated from 𝐺(𝑝, 𝑀), the second Erdős–Rényi model. Each \nbar corresponds to 100 datasets, each generated from a covariance that matches a different \ngraph. The darker bars show values from section 11.2, for comparison, and the white bars show \nthe true values of 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅. The thick lines show maximum achievable values for the experiments \nwith the Erdős–Rényi graphs.  \n \n\n11 Experiments \n \n \n118 \nExperiments with McmcF \nFirst dataset \nThe first set of experiments was done on a dataset with 𝑝= 5 and 𝑛= 30, generated \nfrom a distribution for which the true graph was a star. McmcF was run with a range of \nvalues of 𝜎𝐺 (specifically, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5), for 20 million \niterations in each case. In the true distribution on forests, the probabilities of the top \ntwo graphs are 0.39 and 0.08. With 𝜎𝐺= 0.05, McmcF got the top graph right but \nestimated its probability to be 0.96. With the other values of 𝜎𝐺, McmcF got the top \ngraph wrong and estimated the probabilities of these wrong top graphs to be 0.43 or \nmore. Clearly McmcF failed totally. (In this and the other MCMC experiments there was \nno problem with the updates of Γ. In this case 𝜎𝑖𝑗 was 0.01 and the acceptance-rate for \nupdates of Γ was between 77% and 80%.)  \nIn all cases the most-visited graph was a tree. To see whether McmcF might be getting \nstuck in local optimums, and what kinds of graphs these local optimums might be, I \ncalculated the scores of all the possible forests, in other words the exact true posterior \ndistribution. The top 125 graphs were trees—all the trees had higher scores than all the \nunconnected forests. The top graph was 1.1 million times more likely than the top \nunconnected forest.  \nSecond dataset \nThe second set of experiments was done on a dataset with 𝑝= 5 and 𝑛= 10. Again the \ntrue graph was a star. Because 𝑛 is smaller this might be expected to give a less peaked \nposterior distribution and mix better (Friedman & Koller 2003). McmcF was run with \nthe same values of 𝜎𝐺 as for the first dataset, for 20 million iterations in each case. For \nseven of these experiments it got the top graph wrong. With 𝜎𝐺= 5 it got the top graph \nright, and with 𝜎𝐺= 0.5 it got the top three graphs right and their probabilities right to \nwithin 8%. This was much better than with the first dataset, though it was surprising \nthat the two values of 𝜎𝐺 that worked best were so far apart. \nAgain the most-visited graph was a tree in all the experiments. In the exact true \nposterior distribution, the top 125 graphs were again all trees. But this time the top \ngraph was only 13.8 times more likely than the top unconnected forest.  \nThird dataset \nThe third dataset had 𝑝= 5, 𝑛= 10, and the true graph as in Figure 11.6. The purpose \nof this was to see whether McmcF might mix better when the true graph is not a tree. \nMcmcF was run for 𝜎𝐺= 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5, for 20 million iterations in each case. All three \ntimes, it correctly identified the two most likely graphs. Figure 11.7 shows the top few \ngraphs in the true posterior distribution and for McmcF with 𝜎𝐺= 0.1 (of the three \nvalues, this gave the highest acceptance rate for graph updates, 16%). McmcF seems to \nhave got stuck in certain trees for longer than it should have.  \n \n\n \n11.4 Experiments with MCMC on forests and trees \n \n119 \n \nFigure 11.6.

For the third dataset used with McmcF, the four most likely forests and their proba-\nbilities according to the true posterior distribution (restricted to forests) and according to \nMcmcF with 𝜎𝐺= 0.1.  \n \nOther datasets \nMcmcF works less well with 𝑝> 5. For example, it often spends more than half the time \nat a single graph or has an acceptance rate for graph updates of less than 0.01%. It \nworks well for 𝑝= 4, and gives the correct posterior distribution, but this is no use \nsince exhaustive search of all the possible graphs takes only a few seconds when 𝑝= 4.  \nExperiments with McmcT \nI ran McmcT on datasets like the ones used in section 11.2, with 𝑝= 30 or 𝑝= 100, \nusing a range of values of 𝜎𝐺. It failed to mix with the datasets where 𝑛= 500, but it \nmixed well with the ones where 𝑛= 50. Setting 𝜎𝑖𝑗= 0.01 usually seems to give an \nacceptance rate of 40% or 50%, which in MCMC is generally regarded as good. Setting \n𝜎𝐺 requires more trial and error. If 𝜎𝐺 is too small or too big, the updates almost never \nget accepted, but if it is chosen appropriately then McmcT mixes, at least with the \ndatasets where 𝑛= 50.  \nThe question arises of whether McmcT gives a reasonable approximation to the true \nposterior distribution in a reasonable amount of time, or whether it merely mixes well \n\n11 Experiments \n \n \n120 \namong graphs that do not have high scores. I ran McmcT on two datasets with 𝑝= 30 \nand 𝑛= 50, and recorded several quantities at certain intervals, to see how well it was \nmixing and how long it was taking. I used 𝜎𝐺= 0.5. Figure 11.8 shows the number of \ndistinct graphs visited, 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅, and the true score of the most-visited graph, for these \ntwo experiments. (For McmcT, the true score of the most-visited graph can be used as a \nmeasure of how well the algorithm does. This is analogous to the highest score found in \nSSST.)  \nFor both datasets, the number of distinct graphs visited steadily increased. McmcT \nvisited far more graphs with the chain dataset than with the star dataset, again showing \nthat these two types of graph are greatly different. According to the other two \nquantities, McmcT did somewhat less well than SSST for both graph-shapes. (For the \nSSST results see Figure 11.2.) Taking the chain as an example, with McmcT 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅 \nsettled around 0.144, but with SSST its median was 0.235, and with McmcT the true \nscore of the most-visited graph settled around −2125, but with SSST the highest score \nfound was −2107 (which is better).  \nSSST was only run for 20 seconds, but to do 10 million iterations took McmcT 7 hours \nand 13 minutes for the star and 9 hours and 5 minutes for the chain. Figure 11.8 shows \nthat at least 1 million iterations are needed to get a reasonable result. Overall, SSST \nseems to be better in practice than McmcT, firstly because with McmcT it is necessary to \nexperiment to find suitable values of 𝜎𝑖𝑗 and 𝜎𝐺, and secondly because, once the main \nalgorithms are underway, SSST gives reasonable results much faster. For these reasons, \nI use SSST in the subsequent sections of this chapter.  \nThe failure of McmcF \nAsymptotically, McmcF produces the true posterior distribution. Given a long enough \ntime, it would produce a good approximation. But for 𝑝> 5 or large 𝑛, if it is run for a \nreasonable length of time or a reasonable number of iterations, it does not give a good \napproximation of the posterior distribution and sometimes completely fails to mix.  \nThe reason is probably the high peaks that often seem to appear in the posterior distri-\nbutions. When the true graph is a tree, all the high-scoring graphs tend to be trees, and \nthese trees have much higher scores than the highest-scoring unconnected forests. But \nfor McmcF to get from a tree to another tree it has to first visit an unconnected forest. \n(Obviously, this problem does not arise with McmcT.)  \nFor example, with the first dataset discussed above, the unconnected forests all had far \nlower scores, in the area of a million times lower, than the high-ranking trees. This \nshows that the posterior distribution is very peaked and multimodal. There was also a \npeak at the top-ranking graph, which is also the true graph. Its score is 5 times the score \nof the next graph. This peak probably results from 𝑛 being large compared to 𝑝.  \nThe obvious way to adapt McmcF would be to have different types of moves in the \ngraph spaces. For example, you could add or remove two or more edges at a time. The \nsystem for storing forests described in section 9.3 would have to be adapted, but some \nof the ideas would still be useful. Another possible adaptation would be to sometimes \nmove edges, instead of just adding and removing them—though the algorithm might \nend up only visiting trees, in which case you might as well use McmcT.  \n\n \n11.4 Experiments with MCMC on forests and trees \n \n121 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 11.8. How three aspects of the estimated posterior distribution change over 10 million \niterations of McmcT on two datasets.  \n \n\n11 Experiments \n \n \n122 \nDifferent types of graph-moves is not the only possibility. Karagiannis & Andrieu \n(2012) describe a method that addresses the wider problem of reversible-jump MCMC \nalgorithms getting stuck. To make a proposal, their algorithm chooses a dimension-\nchanging move and then moves about in the new model-space to find parameters that \nwill give higher acceptance probability. The method has desirable asymptotic \nproperties, and it can be applied to the MCMC method of Giudici & Green (1999), \nthough this application is not addressed in the paper.  \nSimilar observations in other research \nFriedman & Koller (2003) discuss in some depth the issue of MCMC for graphical model \nstructure-learning failing to mix well. Their paper is mainly about directed graphical \nmodels but also covers undirected ones. They say that MCMC on the graph structure is \nslow to mix because the posterior distribution is often peaked, meaning that \nneighbouring graphs have very different scores. Even small changes such as removing \nan edge cause large changes in the posterior probability. If 𝑛 is large then the posterior \nwill be sharply peaked at a single model. This corresponds to what I found with McmcF \nand the first dataset.  \nFriedman & Koller (2003) state that “in small domains with a substantial amount of \ndata, it has been shown that the highest scoring model is orders of magnitude more \nlikely than any other.” But the source they cite, Heckerman et al (1997), only shows this \nin one specific example.  \nAltomare et al (2011) say it is now recognized that MCMC methods are not efficient for \nthese problems, because of the huge number of possible graphs and the multimodal \nposterior distributions. Scott & Carvalho (2008) make similar comments. Brooks et al \n(2003) discusses the general issue that in reversible-jump MCMC it is difficult to come \nup with proposals that will get accepted a reasonable proportion of the time. They \nsuggest adapting the method of Giudici & Green (1999) by retaining the previous values \nof the elements of the covariance matrix and using them in choosing the proposed new \nvalues.  \n11.5 Experiments with methods for trees \nOf the quantities in section 11.2, the MTT-based method from section 8.3 can only \nproduce 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅. Figure 11.9 shows 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅 for SSST, run for three different lengths of time, \nand the MTT-based method. These experiments used the same settings as in section \n11.2, and 100 datasets for each group of four bars. The MTT-based method is \ndeterministic and gives exact values, so this is really an assessment of how well SSST \napproximates the true posterior distribution. SSST does reasonably well, though it \noverestimates 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅 in the case of the chain graphs. Perhaps SSST only visits high-\nprobability graphs, but the low-probability graphs have fewer true-positives and still \nmake a noticeable difference to 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅.  \n \n\n \n11.6 Experiments with graph prior distributions \n \n123 \n \nFigure 11.9. Comparison of SSST with the MTT-based method. Each group of four bars \ncorresponds to one combination of covariance matrix and 𝑛, and 100 datasets.  \n \n11.6 Experiments with graph prior distributions \nTo see whether hub-encouraging graph priors can give better results than the uniform \ngraph prior, in the case when the true graph is a star, I ran SSST with the following four \ngraph priors.  \n• \nthe hub-encouraging prior from section 5.7 with 𝜓= 1 and 𝜒= 0.9𝑝 \n• \nthe hub-encouraging prior from section 5.7 with 𝜓= 0.01 and 𝜒= 0.9𝑝 \n• \nthe prior defined by 𝑝(𝐺) ∝exp(maxdeg(𝑣)) \n• \nthe uniform graph prior.  \nSmall values of 𝜓 were used because larger values gave almost no improvement over \nthe uniform prior. The third prior was intended to be strongly hub-encouraging. It gives \nmuch higher probability to graphs that have a single hub, and much higher probability \nto graphs where that hub has higher degree. The four priors were used on the datasets \nfrom section 11.2 for which the true graph was a star, and the results are shown in \nFigure 11.10.  \n \n \n\n11 Experiments \n \n \n124 \n \nFigure 11.10. Experiments to compare hub-encouraging priors with the uniform prior, on four \nsets of datasets. Each bar-chart shows one measure of how well the algorithm did. Each group of \nfour bars shows three hub-encouraging priors and the uniform prior. (As before, each bar shows \nresults with 500 datasets generated from the distribution with the same covariance matrix.)  \n \n\n \n11.7 Experiments with forests, trees, and decomposable graphs \n \n125 \nThe first hub-encouraging prior, with 𝜓= 1  and 𝜒= 0.9𝑝, gave little or no \nimprovement over the uniform prior, and the second, with 𝜓= 0.01, gave some \nimprovement. Overall the third prior was the best.  \nEvidently, graph priors need to give much greater probability to some graphs than to \nothers if they are to have any effect on the posterior. This is presumably because among \nthe marginal likelihoods of all the graphs, some values are many orders of magnitude \ngreater than others. This suggests that one should look at the range of marginal likeli-\nhoods and then decide a suitable range for the graph prior, but that would go against \nthe fundamental principles of Bayesian inference.  \nAs in section 11.2, the datasets with 𝑝= 100 and 𝑛= 50 gave the lowest values. But 0.5 \nor 0.6 are still not bad for the quantities in the second and third bar-charts.  \n11.7 Experiments with forests, trees, and decomposable \ngraphs \nThe final set of experiments are a further investigation of whether restricting to trees or \nforests is sensible. I compared SSST and SSSF with one of the original versions of Jones \net al (2005)’s stochastic shotgun search algorithm. Jones et al (2005) described \nversions of their algorithm for both decomposable and general graphs, but found that \nsearching general graphs “becomes very challenging” as 𝑝 increases past 15. For this \nreason I used the version that is restricted to decomposable graphs. I will call this SSSD. \n(Details of how my programs stored decomposable graphs are given at the end of \nsection 10.1.)  \nThe same datasets were used as in section 11.2. The algorithms were all run for 60 \nseconds on each dataset. For SSSF the values of 𝜔 used in previous sections were too \nbig, because there are often not that many possible moves, so for all the experiments in \nthis section I used 𝜔= 𝑝/2.  \nThe results are shown in Figure 11.11. According to the second and third bar-charts, \nSSST and SSSF did better than SSSD when 𝑛= 500 and the true graph was a chain, SSSD \ndid best when 𝑛= 50, and the three algorithms did roughly as well as each other in the \nother cases. Overall these bar-charts provide some further reassurance that the \nrestriction to trees or forests is reasonable.  \nAs shown by the first bar-chart in Figure 11.11, SSST and SSSF visited far more graphs \nin the same amount of time than SSSD. But the three types of graph have very different \nimplementations. It might be said that SSSD was not given enough time to visit a \nreasonable number of graphs. So I repeated the experiment but ran each algorithm for \n500 iterations rather than 60 seconds.  \nThe results are shown in Figure 11.12. On average, SSSD took 14.9 times longer than \nSSST. But SSST still did better than SSSD according to some of the groups of bars and \nnot much worse according to the others. (Obviously it is still not completely fair to \ncompare the numbers of graphs visited by the three algorithms.)  \n \n\n11 Experiments \n \n \n126 \n \nFigure 11.11.

Chapter 6 showed that \nthere has been plenty of theoretical and applied research using forests and trees and \ngave theoretical reasons in favour of them. Chapters 7 and 8 gave fast algorithms that \ncan be used on them. Chapter 11 provided empirical evidence based on several \nexperiments. Firstly, SSST gave good results in terms of 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅 and the other measures, \nespecially for star graphs and even when 𝑛< 𝑝. Secondly, SSST did reasonably well with \nsparse and locally tree-like graphs that were not forests. Thirdly, SSST did almost as \nwell as SSSD according to the true-positive rates and much better according to the \nnumbers of graphs visited, though these experiments had the drawbacks that the true \ngraphs were trees and the algorithms are not easy to compare because their implemen-\ntations are so different. SSSF also did better than SSSD on some groups of datasets.  \nBayesian structure-learning has no difficulty with 𝑛< 𝑝 and often gives good results in \nterms of true-positive rates, though naturally it is unlikely to give high 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅 if 𝑛≪𝑝. \nRestricting to forests or trees automatically overcomes the problem of stars being \nmisidentified as cliques. It would be interesting to compare graphs produced by the \nalgorithms in Albieri (2010) with graphs produced by the Chow–Liu algorithm and the \nadaptations of it in chapter 7.  \nWhich method is best depends on the purpose of the analysis. But overall it seems \nentirely plausible that there are practical circumstances in which it would be preferable \nto do Bayesian structure-learning on forests and trees, rather than on decomposable \ngraphs or all graphs.  \n12.2 Graph distributions and theoretical results \nThe two ways of looking at graph distributions from chapter 5 should be helpful in \nclarifying ideas about graph distributions. Factored distributions are at least \ntheoretically useful because they can be used in algorithms based on the Chow–Liu \nmethod and MTT.  \nNone of the distributions previously used as priors in Bayesian structure-learning is \nsatisfactory for encouraging hubs. The criteria and priors proposed in section 5.7 are \nmore suitable for this purpose.  \n\n \n12.3 Algorithms for structure-learning with forests or trees \n \n129 \nThe theoretical results in section 6.2 showed how the claim that sparse graphs are \nlocally tree-like can be made rigorous and used to justify restricting attention to forests \nor trees. A possible topic for future research is whether similar theoretical or empirical \nresults can be found for other random graph models such as scale-free graphs.  \nChapter 4 gave a proof of correctness for the algorithm for recursive thinning that is \nused in the R package gRbase, which is one of the main constituents of the large-scale \nproject called “gRaphical models in R”. It also gave a simpler algorithm that is \nsometimes faster.  \n12.3 Algorithms for structure-learning with forests or trees  \nChapter 7 discussed how methods based on the Chow–Liu algorithm can be used with \nGGMs to find the maximum-likelihood tree, the optimal forest using likelihood \npenalized by AIC or BIC, and the MAP forest in Bayesian structure-learning. Chapter 8 \nshowed how the method based on MTT can be used to find certain types of information \nabout the posterior distribution over all trees. All these methods are very fast compared \nto any attempt to approximate the whole posterior distribution, and they all work with \nfactored prior distributions. The drawbacks are that they can only answer certain types \nof questions.  \nChapter 9 presented efficient systems for storing forests and trees so that single-edge \nmoves could easily be chosen uniformly at random and the stored information could \neasily be updated. It might be worth investigating other ways of choosing edge-moves \nin trees, such as adding an edge, identifying the cycle that results, and then removing an \nedge, to see if they perform better.  \n12.4 Computer experiments  \nMany of the experiments in chapter 11 used only four different graphs and two \ndifferent values of 𝑛 (the number of data), so there is obviously plenty of scope for \nmore experiments. For example, the algorithms could be used on data generated from \ndifferent shapes of graphs—perhaps Erdős–Rényi graphs of the first type, scale-free \ngraphs, or specific real-world graphs. It would also be interesting to try them on gene \nexpression data or financial data. Most of the experiments used only trees, so further \nresearch might use forests instead.  \nThe SSS algorithms are designed to be run on parallel or distributed processors. For \ndatasets with much higher 𝑝 it would probably be necessary to use multiple processors. \nIt is certainly advisable to use a fast programming language—I found that Java is 100 \ntimes faster than R.  \nIn experiments using SSST, the system for storing trees had some effect on how many \ngraphs were visited but almost no effect on 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅 or the other measures. 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅 and the \ntrue-positive rates in the top graphs were generally high, especially for the star graphs. \nEspecially good was the result that 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅 was roughly 0.5 for the datasets with 𝑝= 100, \n𝑛= 50, and the true graph a star. SSST did reasonably well on datasets generated from \nsparse and locally tree-like graphs that were not forests. This was the first piece of \nempirical evidence that it may be sensible to restrict attention to trees.  \n\n12 Conclusions \n \n \n130 \nMcmcF did not mix well. McmcT mixed well but took far longer than SSST to give \nreasonable results, and required trial-and-error to find suitable values of the para-\nmeters for the proposal distributions.  \nIn the experiments with the MTT-based methods, the approximations of the true \nposterior distributions produced by SSST gave higher values of 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅 than the true \nposterior distribution. This was especially the case for chain graphs. In a sense this is \nevidence that SSST works well, though it does not address the question of whether \nrestricting to trees is sensible.  \nNext were experiments with graph prior distributions that were designed to encourage \nhubs. The priors proposed in chapter 5 had small effects in some cases, but the more \nextreme prior with 𝑝(𝐺) ∝exp(max deg(𝑣)) was better at identifying the hub when \n𝑛< 𝑝. If graph priors are intended to encourage hubs then they need to give much \nhigher probability to some graphs than others. Obviously there is a large amount of \nscope for further experiments with graph priors that encourage hubs, scale-free degree \nsequences, or other features that are believed to be common in real-world networks. \nHub-encouraging priors could also be used with other algorithms for GGM structure-\nlearning, such as the MCMC method of Green & Thomas (2013), which works with \njunction trees.  \nLastly, section 11.7 compared SSST, for trees, SSSF, for forests, and SSSD, for \ndecomposable graphs. Given the same amount of time, SSST and SSSF visited far more \ngraphs than SSSD. In terms of 𝐸𝑇𝑃𝑅 and the true-positive rate in the top graph, SSST \nand SSSF did better on two sets of datasets, SSSD did best on five, and all three did very \nclose to equally well on one. These results gave further evidence that restricting \nattention to trees or forests may be sensible. The class of decomposable graphs is \nbigger but this was outweighed by the computational simplicity of trees or forests. \nFurther research might compare SSST and SSSF with SSSD on data generated from \ngraphs that are not forests but are locally tree-like.  \n \n\n \n131 \nAppendix I: Graph enumerations \nThis appendix presents the results of some enumerations of decomposable graphs. \nThese numbers are not important or meaningful. However, they have never been found \nbefore, as far as I can tell.  \nTable A1 shows the number of decomposable graphs with 𝑛 nodes, for 𝑛 up to 13. The \nnumbers for 𝑛 up to 12 are from Sloane (2011), which is sequence A058862 on a \nwebsite called Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. The number for 𝑛= 13 does \nnot seem to have appeared anywhere before. I worked it out using a formula on the \nsame webpage and sequence A007134 from the same website. The method for working \nout these numbers is described in Wormald (1985).  \nTable A2 shows the number of decomposable graphs with 𝑛= 9 nodes, for each \npossible number of edges. The analogous numbers for 𝑛 up to 8 are given in Table 7.1 of \nArmstrong (2005). I found the numbers for 𝑛= 9 by writing a program that does a \nmaximum cardinality search (Tarjan & Yannakakis 1984) on every possible graph, to \ntest whether it is decomposable. This program took one week to run on an average \ndesktop computer. But a parallelized version running on a high-powered computer, \nwith twelve 3GHz processors, did it in 6.5 hours. To do the same thing for 𝑛= 10 would \ntake much longer, because there are 1024 times more graphs.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAppendix I: Graph enumerations \n \n \n132 \nn \nNumber of decomposable \ngraphs with n nodes \nPercent of graphs that  \nare decomposable \n1 \n1 \n \n100 \n2 \n2 \n \n100 \n3 \n8 \n \n100 \n4 \n61 \n \n95 \n5 \n822 \n \n80 \n6 \n18 154 \n \n55 \n7 \n617 675 \n \n29 \n8 \n30 888 596 \n \n12 \n9 \n2 192 816 760 \n \n 3.2 \n10 \n215 488 096 587 \n \n 0.61 \n11 \n28 791 414 081 916 \n \n 0.080 \n12 \n5 165 908 492 061 926 \n \n 0.0070 \n13 \n1 234 777 416 771 739 141 \n \n 0.00041 \nTable A1.

The definitions refer to a general graph 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸). Vague terms are \nmarked “(Vague.)” Some of the vague terms have been given precise definitions in \ncertain contexts, as described in the main text.  \nabsent An edge 𝑒 is absent if 𝑒∉𝐸. (Most authors use “missing”, which I think is worse, \nsince firstly it suggests there is something wrong, and secondly it is not the natural \nopposite of “present”, which is clearly the best word for what it means.)  \nchordal graph See section 2.1.  \nclique A maximal complete subgraph.  \ncomponent / connected component A maximal set of nodes such that there is a path \nbetween any pair of them.  \nconnected A graph is connected if for any two nodes 𝑢, 𝑣∈𝑉 there is a path from 𝑢 to 𝑣.  \ncycle A cycle is a path (𝑢1, 𝑢2, … , 𝑢𝑘) where 𝑘≥3 and (𝑢𝑘, 𝑢1) ∈𝐸. (In graph theory, \ncycles are also called “loops” or “circuits”—see for example Even 1979. In Van Lint & \nWilson 2001, a combinatorics book, they are called “polygons”.)  \ndecomposable graph See section 2.1.  \ndegree The degree of a node is the number of edges that are incident to it.  \ndense (Vague.) This is the opposite or negation of “sparse”, q.v. In Bollobás & Riordan \n(2011), dense graphs have Θ(𝑛2) edges.  \ndirected edge An edge (𝑢, 𝑣) such that (𝑣, 𝑢) ∉𝐸. A directed edge (𝑢, 𝑣) is drawn as an \narrow from 𝑢 to 𝑣.  \ndirected graph A graph in which all the edges are directed. (Pearl 1988, page 232, uses \n“multiply connected network” to mean a directed graph that is not necessarily a \nforest.)  \ndirected path \nIn a directed graph, a sequence of nodes 𝑢1, 𝑢2, … , 𝑢𝑘 such that \n(𝑢1, 𝑢2), (𝑢2, 𝑢3), … , (𝑢𝑘−1, 𝑢𝑘) ∈𝐸 and 𝑢𝑖≠𝑢𝑗 for 𝑖≠𝑗. \ndistance The distance between two nodes is the number of edges on the shortest path \nbetween them.  \nforest A graph that has no cycles. It can also be defined as a graph whose connected \ncomponents are all trees, q.v. (Pearl 1988 calls directed forests “polytrees” and \n“singly connected networks”.)  \ngirth The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle that it contains, or ∞ if it \nhas no cycles. So a graph is chordal (q.v.) if and only if its girth is either 3 or ∞.  \nhub (Vague.) A node whose degree is large.  \nincident An edge (𝑢, 𝑣) is incident to a node 𝑤 if 𝑤= 𝑢 or 𝑤= 𝑣.  \nleaf A node, especially in a tree or forest, whose degree is 1.  \n\nAppendix II: Glossary of terms related to graphs \n \n \n134 \nlength of a path The number of edges on the path.  \nlocally tree-like (Vague.) This has been interpreted in several ways, for example to \nmean that there are few short cycles or that there are none. See section 6.2.  \nmultiple edges More than one edge between the same pair of nodes.  \nneighbour A neighbour of 𝑣 is a node 𝑢 such that (𝑢, 𝑣) ∈𝐸 or (𝑣, 𝑢) ∈𝐸.  \npath See also section 2.1.  \n(a) In an undirected graph, a path is a sequence of nodes 𝑢1, 𝑢2, … , 𝑢𝑘 such that \n(𝑢1, 𝑢2), (𝑢2, 𝑢3), … , (𝑢𝑘−1, 𝑢𝑘) ∈𝐸 and 𝑢𝑖≠𝑢𝑗 for 𝑖≠𝑗.  \n(b) In a directed graph, a path is a sequence of nodes 𝑢1, 𝑢2, … , 𝑢𝑘 such that either \n(𝑢1, 𝑢2) ∈𝐸 or (𝑢2, 𝑢1) ∈𝐸, either (𝑢2, 𝑢3) ∈𝐸 or (𝑢3, 𝑢2) ∈𝐸, …, either (𝑢𝑘−1, 𝑢𝑘) ∈\n𝐸 or (𝑢𝑘, 𝑢𝑘−1) ∈𝐸, and 𝑢𝑖≠𝑢𝑗 for 𝑖≠𝑗. This is my definition, and it is non-\nstandard. (Under standard definitions, a path in a directed graph has to be directed, \nand what I call a path would probably be called an “undirected path”.)  \n(c) For there to be a path between 𝐴⊆𝑉 and 𝐵⊆𝑉 means that there is a path \nbetween some 𝑢∈𝐴 and some 𝑣∈𝐵.  \npresent An edge 𝑒 is present if 𝑒∈𝐸.  \nrooted forest A directed forest in which each component is a rooted tree. (Heckerman \net al 1995, page 226, calls these “branchings”.)  \nrooted tree See Definition 9.1 in section 9.2. A directed tree in which one node is \ndesignated the root, and the paths from the root to all the other nodes are directed \npaths. The text just after Definition 9.1 gives three other equivalent definitions. \n(Heckerman et al 1995, page 226, calls these “tree-like networks”. Pearl 1988, pages \n143 and 150, uses “causal tree” to mean a rooted tree graphical model.)  \nself-loop An edge from a node to itself (Mateti & Deo 1976, page 90). \nseparate (verb) Suppose 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶⊆𝑉. If all paths from 𝐴 to 𝐶 pass through 𝐵, then 𝐵 \nseparates 𝐴 from 𝐶. See Lauritzen (1996, page 6).  \nsimple A graph is simple if it has no self-loops or multiple edges (Mateti & Deo 1976).  \nsize The size of 𝐺 is |𝐸|, the number of edges. (This term is used in graph theory and in \nArmstrong et al 2009.) \nspan (verb) A graph 𝐻 spans a graph 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸), or a set of nodes 𝑉, if it is connected \nand the nodes of 𝐻 are 𝑉. See also spanning.  \nspanning A spanning tree of a connected graph (𝑉, 𝐸) is a tree (𝑉, 𝐸′) such that 𝐸′ ⊆𝐸. \nThis word is also used loosely in the phrase “spanning forest” (Edwards et al 2010, \nLauritzen 2006). A spanning forest of a graph (𝑉, 𝐸) is a forest (𝑉, 𝐸′) such that 𝐸′ ⊆\n𝐸.  \nsparse (Vague.) A sparse graph is one that has few edges. For concrete definitions see \nsection 6.2.  \ntree A connected graph that has no cycles. It can also be defined as a connected forest. \nIn the machine-learning community, “tree” is sometimes used to mean forest (Bach \n& Jordan 2003, Bradley & Guestrin 2010), in which case trees are referred to as \n“spanning trees”. \ntriangulated graph See section 2.1.  \nundirected edge An unordered pair (𝑢, 𝑣) ∈𝐸; alternatively, an ordered pair (𝑢, 𝑣) such \nthat (𝑢, 𝑣) ∈𝐸 and (𝑣, 𝑢) ∈𝐸.  \nundirected graph A graph in which all the edges are undirected. \nundirected path See path (b).  \n\n \n135 \nAppendix III: Asymptotic notations \nThese are used in chapter 6.  \n• \n𝑓(𝑛) = 𝑂(𝑔(𝑛)) means there are some numbers 𝑘 and 𝑁 such that |𝑓(𝑛)| ≤\n𝑘|𝑔(𝑛)| for all 𝑛≥𝑁.  \n• \n𝑓(𝑛) = Θ(𝑔(𝑛)) means there are some numbers 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑁> 0 such that 𝑎𝑔(𝑛) ≤\n𝑓(𝑛) ≤𝑏𝑔(𝑛) for all 𝑛≥𝑁.

Remove previous from ch(current)”. In the two paragraphs just \nbefore this algorithm, the references to line-numbers in the algorithm have been corrected accordingly.  \n• In section 11.1, in the proof of Proposition 11.3, the second g(W(v2)) has been changed to g(W(v3)). \n• In section 11.7, “to give SSSD a chance to visit a reasonable number of graphs” has been moved from the caption of Figure \n11.11 to the caption of Figure 11.12.  \nSeveral copyediting errors have also been corrected.",
