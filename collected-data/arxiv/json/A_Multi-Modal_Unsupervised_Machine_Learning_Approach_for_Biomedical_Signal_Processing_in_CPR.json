The American Heart Association, alongside other global health\norganizations,underscoresthesignificanceofCPRtraining,notjustamonghealthcareprofessionalsbutalsoamong\nthe general public (Hinkelbein et al., 2020), as the majority of cardiac arrests occur outside of hospital settings,\nwhere immediate medical intervention may not readily available. In such scenarios, manual, human-driven CPR\nis predominantly practiced despite several difficulties and challenges that hinder successful CPR. For instance,\nperforming CPR is physically demanding for individuals, even for health care providers for an extended period.\n4202\nvoN\n3\n]PS.ssee[\n1v96811.1142:viXra\nMoreover, it is difficult to maintain the correct compression depth, rate, and consistency. Additionally, obtaining\nreal-time feedback is significantly challenging, which is very crucial during the initial treatment in ambulances or\nhospital environments. To address these limitations, there has been a growing need for automated CPR systems\noverthelasttwodecades,drivenbyadvancementsinmechanicaldeviceswithinthehealthcaresystem (Sworetal.,\n2006). Automated CPR systems offer the potential to enhance the effectiveness of life-saving interventions by\nensuring optimal compression and decompression at precise intervals for long periods. However, automating CPR\nfacesseveralchallengesrelatedtodecision-makingandaccuracyincompressionanddecompression. Inthisregard,\nArtificialintelligence(AI),particularlymachinelearning(ML),offersapromisingwaytoaddresstheselimitationsin\nmedicaloperations. MLiscapableofidentifyingcomplexpatternsinbiomedicaldata,improvingthequalityofCPR\nin medical systems, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and enabling real-time monitoring of CPR in diverse medical\nconditions (Hallstrom et al., 2006). Furthermore, various biomedical signals associated with CPR—such as blood\npressure, velocity, force, andrespiratorywaveforms—playacriticalroleinguidingtreatmentdecisions, particularly\nin intensive care units (ICUs). Accurate monitoring and processing of these signals during CPR is essential for\nassessingpatientresponse,informingmedicalinterventions,andultimatelyimprovingpatientoutcomes(Hurt,2005).\nCPRsignalsareinherentlydynamicandtime-sensitive,requiringspecializedapproachesforeffectiveprocessingand\ndecision-making. Moreover, these signals are often corrupted by various types of noise sources, including baseline\nwander, electrode artifacts, motion artifacts, and electromagnetic interference, which significantly degrade signal\nquality and complicate interpretation (Fitzgibbon et al., 2002). Ensuring the integrity and quality of signal data is\ncrucialforeffectiveMLapproachesinaccuratedecision-makingforCPRautomationandmonitoringsystems. While\ntraditional signal processing techniques such as filtering, offer some improvements, they often struggle to remove\nnoiseeffectivelywithoutcompromisingessentialphysiologicalfeatures(Luongetal.,2013). SinceCPRisaprocess\nof emergency healthcare, where decision-making can directly impact survival, it is unacceptable to compromise the\nqualityofthesignal. Therefore,achievingeffectivedenoisingwhilepreservingkeysignalcharacteristicsisessential.\nMoreover, one limitation of conventional filters lies in their dependence on predefined parameters—such as cutoff\nfrequencies or filter orders—and assumptions regarding noise characteristics, which may not correspond to the\ncomplexanddynamicnatureofreal-worldCPRsignals. Traditionalfiltersoftenstruggletoeffectivelyremovenoise\nwithoutinadvertentlydistortingorattenuatingimportantsignalcomponents,leadingtothepotentiallossofvaluable\ninformation. Additionally, filters are generally tailored to specific noise types or signal modalities, limiting their\nadaptability to diverse noise profiles and environments (Seron et al., 2012). These inherent constraints underscore\nthe need for more flexible and adaptive denoising techniques capable of preserving critical signal features. Given\nthe high-stakes nature of CPR, where accurate signal interpretation is a matter of life and death, overcoming these\nlimitationsisessentialforadvancingautomatedCPRsystemsandimprovingpatientoutcomes.\nTheapplicationofmachinelearning(ML)hasemergedasapromisingapproachtotacklingcriticaltasksinmedical\nsystems. ML excels at identifying complex patterns and relationships within biomedical data, offering solutions\nthat can enhance diagnostic accuracy, improve healthcare systems, and enable real-time monitoring across a variety\nof medical conditions (Blum & Langley, 1997). Within the domain of CPR, integrating ML presents unique\nopportunities, as CPR signals are both dynamic and time-sensitive, requiring specialized approaches for effective\nprocessinganddecision-making. ML-basedapproaches,particularlyfortaskssuchasdenoisingandsignalenhance-\nment, demonstrate the ability to learn from diverse, heterogeneous, and noisy data, thus showing great potential in\ndeciphering the intricate nuances inherent in CPR signals. Moreover, recent advancements in computational power,\nparticularlywiththeadventofhigh-performanceGPUsandcloudcomputingplatforms,havesignificantlyimproved\nthe feasibility of deploying ML algorithms in real-time applications, thus facilitating timely insights in critical\nmedical scenarios such as CPR (Azghadi et al., 2020). Such advancements can substantially improve the accuracy\nandreliabilityofreal-timemonitoringduringlife-savinginterventions. However, despitethesepromisingprospects,\napplyingMLalgorithmstoCPRsignaldenoisingpresentsseveralnotablechallenges. Theseincludethedevelopment\nof robust feature extraction methodologies that are tailored to the unique characteristics of CPR signals, selecting\nappropriate ML frameworks and models capable of processing temporal data and noise, and acquisition of labeled\ndatasets for supervised learning tasks (Schelter et al., 2015). Existing ML approaches for CPR signal denoising are\npredominantly supervised, relying on clean labeled data that corresponds to noisy signals. In real-world scenarios,\nobtaining such labeled data is extremely difficult, if not impractical, thereby limiting the applicability of supervised\nML methods. Consequently, there is a clear need for an unsupervised ML approach dedicated to CPR signals that\ncan effectively denoise CPR signals without reliance on labeled data. Currently, no unsupervised ML methodology\nspecificallydesignedforCPRsignaldenoisinghasbeendeveloped,leavingagapintheexistingresearchlandscape.\n2\n1.2 NOVELTYANDCONTRIBUTIONS\nIn this paper, we address the challenges by introducing an advanced method for CPR signal denoising and artifact\nremoval, aimed at enhancing patient outcomes and healthcare delivery. A novel unsupervised ML methodology\nhas been proposed, specifically designed for denoising biomedical signals during CPR. The framework introduces\na multi-modality approach, enabling the concurrent processing of multiple signals while addressing the noise\ncharacteristics of each signal individually. This individualized signal processing facilitates the extraction of unique\nfeatures, thereby improving the overall denoising process and enhancing the accuracy of signal interpretation. A\nkey feature of the proposed framework is its use of unsupervised ML, which demonstrates the method’s capability\ntoeffectivelyremovenoiseandenhancesignalfidelitywithouttheneedforlabeleddata. Byidentifyingunderlying\nstructuresandpatternsinnoisyCPRsignaldata,thisapproachisparticularlywell-suitedforreal-worldapplications,\nwhere labeled ground truth is often scarce or unavailable. The key contributions of this paper are as follows: (i)\na comprehensive exploration of existing denoising approaches for CPR signals, (ii) the introduction of a novel\nmulti-modal ML methodology that processes multiple signals simultaneously, (iii) the use of an unsupervised ML\napproach, eliminating the dependency on labeled data, (iv) the generation of synthetic biomedical CPR signals for\nresearch purposes, and (v) the conceptualization of a multi-modal ML framework for enhanced decision-making in\nmedicalemergencies.\nMoreover,acomprehensivecomparisonoftheproposedmethodhasbeenconductedwithexistingMLandfiltermeth-\nods in an unsupervised context to justify the performance of the proposed methodology. The effectiveness of the\nmethodology is demonstrated through visualizations, as well as signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) and peak signal-to-noise\nratio(PSNR) scores.

The framework considers various types of noise and interference that can\ncompromisetheintegrityofthesesignals,suchasbaselinewander,motionartifacts,andelectromagneticinterference,\nandaimstoenhancetheoverallsignalqualityduringprocessing. Thecoreofthismethodintegratesamulti-modality\nconcept alongside several ML techniques, including autoencoders, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and\nresidual connections. Each component plays a crucial role in forming an unsupervised CPR signal processing\nframework.\n3.1 MULTI-MODALITYAPPROACH\nThere are several motivating factors for choosing a multi-modality approach for effective CPR signal processing.\nFirst, it holds substantial promise for improving healthcare effectiveness by integrating various types of medical\ndata, leading to more comprehensive, accurate, and personalized patient assessments Muhammad et al. (2021).\nIn addition, multi-modality can enhance model transparency and the overall explainability of AI applications in\nhealthcare, opening doors to a broader range of clinical applications and making outcomes more interpretable for\npractitioners Yang et al. (2022), Wang et al. (2020). In general, multi-modal deep learning is an approach that\nintegrates information from various types of data, like text, images, and audio, to enhance model performance and\naccuracy. In this method, each data modality is initially processed independently using specialized neural networks\ntailored to the specific characteristics of that modality, as illustrated in Figure 1. These networks extract high-level\nfeatures from the data and encode them into lower-dimensional representations, capturing essential patterns while\nreducingnoiseandredundancy. Oncefeaturesfromeachmodalityareextracted,theyarefusedintoasingle,unified\nrepresentation. This can happen early on when the raw data is combined before processing to learn cross-modal\nrelationships,orlaterwhentheprocessedfeaturesarecombinedusingdifferentmethods(Suetal.,2021).\nDeep learning\nText\nModel\nModel for\nDeep learning\nVisual Combined output\nModel\nProcessing\nDeep learning\nAudio\nModel\nFigure1: GeneralMulti-Modalityapproachfordifferenttypesofdata.\nOncethecombinedrepresentationisformed, aunifiedmodelutilizesittomakepredictionsorperformdownstream\ntasks. The architecture of this joint model can vary in complexity, ranging from simple concatenation followed by\nfully connected layers to more complex architectures. During training, the model’s parameters—including those of\nthe modality-specific networks and the fusion layers—are updated simultaneously through backpropagation. This\nensuresthatallcomponentsworkinharmony,optimizingtheoverallsystemtominimizethelossfunctionandalign\npredictions with the true labels or outputs. By integrating information from different modalities, multi-modal deep\nlearning allows the model to capture richer, more nuanced representations of the data. This, in turn, enables the\nsystem to handle more complex tasks and improves its ability to generalize, making it particularly well-suited for\n5\napplications where diverse data sources are available, such as medical diagnosis or real-time monitoring in critical\nsettings(DiMitrietal.,2018).\n3.2 AUTOENCODER\nAn autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network designed to efficiently represent data by making its output\n(reconstructed data) as close as possible to the clean input data. It can be used in two main ways: supervised\nand unsupervised. In the supervised method, pairs of noisy input data and their corresponding clean versions are\ngiven to the autoencoder for training. However, in the unsupervised approach, only noisy input data is used for\ntraining,withoutanycleandata. Duringtraining,theautoencoderlearnstoencodethenoisyinputdataintoahidden\nrepresentation,capturingtheimportantpatternsandstructureofthedata(Fengetal.,2024).\nLatent Space\nEncoder Decoder\nFigure2: VanillaAutoencodermodel.\nThe autoencoder consists of two main components: the encoder and decoder. The encoder takes input data and\ntransformsitintoacompactrepresentationcalledalatentrepresentation,asshowninFigure2. Itusesneuralnetwork\narchitectureslikerecurrentneuralnetworks(RNNs),LSTMnetworks,CNNs,etc.,toextractimportantfeaturesfrom\nthe input data. The goal of the encoder is to create a condensed version of the input that captures its important\ncharacteristics while removing noise. It considers both spatial (how data points relate to each other in space) and\ntemporal(howdatachangesovertime)aspectsoftheinputtoensurethatvitalinformationispreservedwhilenoiseis\nfilteredouteffectively. Ontheotherhand,thedecoderpartoftheautoencoderworksalongsidetheencoder. Itsjobis\ntoreconstructoutputdatafromthelatentrepresentationsproducedbytheencoder. Bycollaboratingcloselywiththe\nencoder, the decoder reverses the process of dimensionality reduction that occurred during encoding. This means it\nrestorestheoriginalstructureandfeaturesoftheinputdata,translatingthembackintohigh-dimensionaloutputdata.\nThroughaseriesofiterations,thedecoderaimstominimizethedifferencebetweentheoutputandtheoriginalinput\ndata, ensuring that the reconstructed data closely resembles the original signal while effectively removing noise (Li\netal.,2023).\n3.3 CONVOLUTIONNEURALNETWORK\nOne-dimensionalConvolutionalNeuralNetworks(1DCNNs)areessentialcomponentsindeeplearningarchitectures,\nknownfortheirabilitytocaptureintricatecomplexpatternsandspatialrelationshipswithinsequentialdata. Atypical\n1DCNNconsistsofthreeprimarycomponents: convolutionallayers,poolinglayers,andfullyconnectedlayers,each\nserving a distinct function. In the convolutional layer, learnable filters are applied to input data using convolution\noperations, generating feature maps that encode local patterns (Kiranyaz et al., 2019). These filters learn to detect\nspecific features by scanning across the input data’s spatial dimensions. Pooling layers are responsible for reducing\nthe size of feature maps while preserving important information. Techniques like max pooling or average pooling\naggregatefeaturemapvalueswithinlocalizedregions,helptosummarizefeaturepresenceacrossdifferentareasand\nimprove computational efficiency. Finally, fully connected layers combine extracted features from previous layers,\nallowing the network to perform specific tasks. These layers establish connections between all neurons in adjacent\nlayers,facilitatingtherepresentationofhigh-levelfeaturesandmakingpredictionstailoredtothetaskathand(Lietal.,\n2021).

Traditional ML methods\ntreatsignalscollectively,butdenoisingwhilepreservingtheirinterrelationshipsisdifficultduetoeachsignal’sunique\ncharacteristics (Assegie et al., 2021). To address this, we propose an ML-based methodology that denoises each\nsignal individually while maintaining their correlations, improving accuracy and reliability for downstream tasks\nlikereal-timemonitoring. Intheproposedframework, theconceptofmulti-modalityisleveragedtosimultaneously\nprocessmultiplesignalswhileindividuallydenoisingeachsignalbeforeamalgamatingthemintoaunifiedinputdata\nshape,asdepictedinFigure3.

Given the primary objective of this framework—denoising—the autoencoder model is employed\ndue to its flexibility for use in both supervised and unsupervised learning settings. While the supervised approach\ninvolves training the autoencoder with pairs of noisy input data and corresponding clean data, the unsupervised\nmethodischosenforconsideringourreal-lifescenario. Inthisunsupervisedsetting,theautoencoderlearnstoencode\nnoisy input data into a latent representation, capturing underlying structures and patterns without relying on labeled\nclean data and then generating new data from the latent space using the decoder. Several architectural variations of\nautoencoders exist, such as RNNs, LSTMs, CNNs, and attention-based models (Ling et al., 2024). Given the need\nto capture local features and complex patterns in the CPR signals, CNN-based denoising autoencoders have been\nadoptedacrossallmodalities. CNNsareparticularlywell-suitedforthistaskduetotheircapacityforeffectivefeature\nextractionandtheirrobustnessinhandlingnoisevariations,makingthemidealforprocessingbiomedicalsignals. The\nstandardizeduseofCNN-basedautoencodersensuresconsistentperformanceacrossdifferentsignals.

In our\nautoencoder, two(2)layers of 1-dimensional CNN are deployed in both the encoder and decoder. After each of the\n1D-Convolution layers, a max-pooling-1D layer has been placed in the encoder to compress the signals into latent\nspace, asinFigure4. However, upsampling1Dlayershavebeenusedinthecaseofthedecodertogeneratesignals\nfrom the latent space. One notable enhancement in our autoencoder is the incorporation of a residual connection.\nThis connection involves introducing an additional convolutional layer after the last max-pooling-1D layer in the\nencoder, which captures supplementary features or representations from the encoder’s output (Qassim et al., 2018).\nSubsequently, the output of this residual layer is combined with the output of the last convolutional layer of the\nencoder. This combined output is then passed through upsampling layers to prepare it for concatenation with the\ninputofthedecoder. Byincorporatingtheresidualconnectioninthismanner,theautoencoderisenabledtoleverage\nthe information captured by the residual layer, enhancing its denoising capabilities.

Ultimately,\nthe inclusion of residual connections contributes to a clearer and more accurate reconstruction of the input signal,\nleadingtoimprovedsignalquality(Luo&Wu,2020).\n4.2 METHODOLOGYIMPLEMENTATION\nAccessing real-world medical data, particularly CPR data poses significant challenges due to privacy concerns and\nregulatory constraints. These limitations make it difficult to utilize actual patient data for machine learning (ML)\nresearch in the CPR context. Despite an extensive search for publicly available CPR datasets, all identified datasets\nare private and restricted, creating a significant barrier to progress in this field. As a result, alternative data sources\nare necessary to advance research and development. To overcome this obstacle, the generation of synthesized data\nhasemergedasaviablesolution. Simulateddataallowsforexperimentation,algorithmdevelopment,andvalidation\nwhile avoiding privacy issues and regulatory hurdles. The Babbs model, a well-established mathematical model for\nsimulating CPR processes, was identified as the most suitable framework for this task (Shin & Lee, 2021, Jalali\netal.,2015). ThismodelisrenownedforitsabilitytoaccuratelyreplicatethecomplexdynamicsofCPR,including\nvariations in signal morphology and the introduction of realistic noise. By leveraging the Babbs model, realistic\nCPRscenariosaresimulated,enablingrobustresearchintoCPRsignalprocessing,monitoringsystems,anddecision-\nmakingalgorithmswithoutcompromisingpatientconfidentiality(Fitzgeraldetal.,1981).\n8\nFigure4:UsedResidualconnectedCNN-baseddenoisingautoencoderinMulti-modalMachineLearningFramework.\n4.2.1 DATAGENERATION\nThe Babbs model is a comprehensive mathematical framework that describes the physiological changes occurring\nduring CPR.

All of these factors make the Babbs\nmodel a reliable tool for simulating CPR scenarios and optimizing resuscitation techniques (Babbs & Thelander,\n1995).\nTheBabbsmodelequationscanbesummarizedasfollows:\nDBP ×Duty\nCPP = (3)\nDuty+ 1\nR\nDBP =E×D−F ×D2 (4)\nEmax−Emin\nE =Emin+ (5)\n1+exp(PE×(Dtarget−D))\nF max−F min\nF =F min+ (6)\n1+exp(PF ×(Dtarget−D))\nwherethevariablesareasfollows: CPP: CoronaryperfusionpressureduringCPR;DBP: Diastolicbloodpressure\nduring CPR; D: Chest compression depth; R : Chest compression rate; Duty: Chest compression duty cycle; E:\nElastance of the arterial system; F: Resistance of the arterial system; Emin, Emax: Minimum and maximum\nelastancevalues;F min,F max: Minimumandmaximumresistancevalues;PE,PF: Modelparameters;Dtarget:\n9\nTargetchestcompressiondepth.\nThe Babbs model optimizes chest compression parameters during CPR by providing real-time feedback to guide\nrescuers in achieving optimal chest compressions. The algorithm implementation involves measuring compression\ndepth,dutycycle,andrateduringCPRandusingthesevaluestocalculateCPPbasedontheBabbsmodelequations.\nThe calculated CPP is then compared to the optimal CPP target range, and the algorithm provides feedback to the\nrescuerstoadjustcompressionparametersaccordingly.

The five key signals that are critical for\neffectiveCPRoperationshavebeenselectedforexperimentation: Compression,BloodPressure,Velocity,Force,and\nPmouth (Jung et al., 2006). These signals provide essential insights into the physiological response during chest\ncompressions and the overall effectiveness of CPR.

These additional noise components are strategically introduced to mimic the diverse sources of interference\ncommonly encountered in real-world CPR signals. By augmenting the simulated data with realistic noise, a more\nfaithful representation of the complexities and challenges inherent in CPR monitoring scenarios is aimed to be\ncreated. Thisapproachensuresthattheresearchexperimentsandalgorithmdevelopmentsarerobustlytestedagainsta\nspectrumofnoisepatterns,thusincreasingthevalidityandapplicabilityofthefindingstoreal-worldclinicalsettings.\nThrough this meticulous process of noise augmentation, the gap between simulated and actual CPR data strives to\nbebridged,ultimatelyadvancingthefieldofCPRmonitoringandsignalprocessingwithgreaterfidelityandrelevance.\nGaussianNoise:\nIn the context of CPR signal data, adding Gaussian noise is a crucial step in enhancing the realism and authenticity\nof simulated data for research purposes. Gaussian noise, also known as white noise, follows a normal distribution\ncharacterizedbyitsmeanµandvarianceσ2:\nNoise=µ+σ×N(0,1) (7)\nFor this study, we tested specific parameter values: a mean of 0 and a standard deviation (or variance) of 1. These\nvalueswereselectedtosimulatetypicalnoiseconditionsencounteredduringCPR.Toreflectmoreextremeconditions,\nsuch as a noisy ambulance environment, we increased the standard deviation to introduce greater variability and\nmimic higher levels of interference. Additionally, by setting a noise factor of 1.2 and a noise probability of 0.1,\nwe controlled the intensity and likelihood of noise affecting the clean CPR signals. This controlled introduction of\nvariability captures the stochastic nature of real-world noise during CPR monitoring, ensuring that the data more\naccuratelyreflectsconditionsencounteredinclinicalsettings. (Goceri,2023).\nAdditionally, the noise probability parameter controls the likelihood of noise being added to each element of\nthe signal, further enhancing the realism of the simulated data. This approach replicates various sources of inter-\nference, such as electrical noise, sensor inaccuracies, or environmental disturbances. For example, real-world CPR\nmonitoringscenariosofteninvolvenoisefrommovingequipment,patientmovementduringcompressions,orchaotic\nsettings like ambulances where vibrations and varying patient profiles can introduce significant interference. By\nincorporatingGaussiannoiseintothecleanCPRdata,thealgorithmsandmethodologiescanberigorouslyevaluated\nundermorepracticalconditionsthatcloselymimictheunpredictablenatureofclinicalenvironments(Kassam,2012).\nThis noise augmentation process facilitates the development of more robust CPR monitoring and decision-making\n10\nFigure5: GeneratedCPR-Compression,Pressure,velocity,Force,Pmouthsignals.\n11\nsystems,ensuringtheproposedsolutionscaneffectivelyaddressthechallengesposedbyreal-worldscenarios.\nSalt&PaperNoise:\nIninvestigatingCPRsignaldata,salt-and-peppernoiseisintroducedtosimulateimpulsivedisturbancesoftenencoun-\ntered in real-world monitoring environments. This noise type mimics issues like sensor anomalies or transmission\nirregularities,whichcanaffecttheprecisionofCPRsignalassessments. Thechosenparametersforthisnoise,include\nsalt probability = 0.0001, pepper probability = 0.0001, and salt and pepper values = 0.00001. These values reflect\ntypicalerrormarginsinsensorreadingsandmomentarytransmissionglitchesobservedduringCPRmonitoring. For\ninstance, lowprobabilitiessuchas0.0001wereselectedtorepresentrarebutimpactfuloccurrences, suchassudden\nmalfunctions in medical equipment or brief disruptions in signal transmission, which are infrequent but can lead to\nsignificant distortions in the data. The salt and pepper values (0.00001) represent extremely low and high-intensity\nvalues, simulating hardware malfunctions that inject sharp spikes or drops into the data (Azzeh et al., 2018). This\nmethodology ensures the simulated data realistically mimics real-life noise scenarios, where occasional, sudden,\nand extreme disturbances can impair signal integrity during CPR operations. By simulating these conditions, our\napproach enables the robust evaluation of algorithms, ensuring they are equipped to handle the unpredictability of\nactualclinicalenvironments(Erkanetal.,2018).\nSimulateBaselineWander:\nTheBaselineWander,modeledasasinusoidalwaveform,introducessubtlevariationsthatcapturethecomplexities\ninherentinCPRsignalanalysis,whereT representstheperiodofthesinewave(timeforonecompletecycle)andt\ninstantaneoustimeatwhichthefunctionisevaluated.

By incorporating these nuanced fluctuations, the dataset becomes better suited for exploring diverse\nresearch directions and improving algorithmic performance, ultimately advancing the reliability of CPR monitoring\nandanalysistechniques.\nMuscleInterference:\nIn our data augmentation process for CPR signal data, Muscle Interference has resembled using a function with\na specified amplitude parameter of 0.05. Muscle interference represents the unpredictable noise that arises from\ninvoluntary muscle contractions, movement artifacts, or electrical noise from surrounding muscles and it masks the\nfeaturesoftheunderlyingsignal. Byaddingmuscleinterferencewiththisparameter, realisticvariationsintheCPR\nsignals are simulated, mimicking the effects of muscle-related artifacts that are observed in real-world monitoring\nscenarios. The simulated interference is generated as Gaussian noise with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation\ncorrespondingtothespecifiedamplitude,whichenrichestheCPRsignalsbyintroducingnuancednoisepatternsthat\nrepresentthecomplexitiesofCPRsignal(Murach&Bagley,2016).\nMuscleInterference=amplitude×N(0,1) (9)\nThisaugmentationwillenhancetheresilienceofCPRsignalsandfacilitatemorecomprehensiveresearchexploration\nand algorithm development, which will help to improve the accuracy and reliability of CPR signal processing\nalgorithms.\nSimulateSuddenAmplitudeChanges:\nMoreover, a unique approach is implemented by applying the simulated sudden amplitude changes function.

This\ncustomfunctionisdesignedtoreplicatefluctuationsincompressiondepthwhichisacommonoccurrenceinmedical\nsignals due to changes in applied pressure or physiological dynamics. By strategically adjusting these parameters,\na wide range of compression depth variations is introduced into our signals. These parameters were deliberately\nchosen to mirror the unpredictable nature of compression depth changes observed in real-world CPR monitoring\nscenariosandprovideafaithfulrepresentationofdynamicsignalcharacteristics. Thisaugmentationstrategyenhances\nthe adaptability of CPR signal processing algorithms which enables them to effectively navigate fluctuations in\ncompressiondepthwithaccuracyandprecision(Considineetal.,2020).\nSimulateMultipleDropouts:\nFinally,themultipledropoutsfunctionhasbeenappliedbyconfiguringwithparameterssuchasnumdropouts=500\nand max dropout duration = 10.

We trained our model in an\nunsupervisedmannerwithnoisyCPRsignalsofonlythree(3)differentpatientdataandsplitthedataintotrain(80%)\nand validation(20%) sets for training purposes.

SNR is defined as the ratio\nof the power of the signal to the power of the noise. In mathematical terms, SNR is often expressed in decibels\n(dB)usingalogarithmicscale,whichallowsforeasyinterpretationoftheratio. AhigherSNRvalueindicatesthat\nthe signal is stronger relative to the noise, which generally leads to better signal quality and improved performance\nin various applications. SNR plays a crucial role in determining the reliability and accuracy of signal-processing\nalgorithms, making it an essential concept in multiple fields. It provides a quantitative measure of signal quality\nrelative to background noise (Jiang et al., 2016). Mathematically, SNR is defined as the ratio of the power of the\nsignal(S)tothepowerofthenoise(N). Thisratioisoftenexpressedindecibels(dB)usingalogarithmicscale:\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\nS\nSNR =10·log (10)\ndB 10 N\nPeak Signal-to-Noise Ratio: Moreover, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) is a specific form of SNR popularly\nused in image processing to evaluate the image noise. Its underlying concept is also applied to other types of data\nlike signals. PSNR measures the ratio between the maximum possible power of a signal M and the power of the\nnoiseintroducedbycompressionorotherformsofdistortion. PSNRisexpressedindecibels(dB),allowingforeasy\ncomparison of signal quality across different techniques. A higher PSNR value indicates that the denoised signal\nisclosertothe original, noise-free signal, suggesting bettersignalqualitywithlessdistortionorloss ofinformation\n(Baigetal.,2019). UnlikeSNR, PSNRisoftencalculatedbasedoncontinuoussignalsandexpressedindecibels\n(dB), which is calculated using the mean squared error (MSE) between the original noise-free signal (S) and the\ndistortedsignal(S):\n(cid:18) M2 (cid:19)\nPSNR =10·log (11)\ndB 10 MSE\nBothSNR andPSNR areusedtoanalyzetheeffectivenessoftheproposedmethodologyandcompareitwiththe\nexistingMLandfiltermethods. ThebargraphinFigure10comparestheproposed, filterandexistingMLmethods\nwithout labeled data concerning SNR and PSNR metrics for evaluating signal denoising quality. The proposed\nmethod demonstrates substantial improvements over both of the existing methods in terms of SNR and PSNR\nmetrics. Specifically,ourproposedmethodachievesasignificantlyhigherSNRof27.73,outperformingthefilterand\ntheexistingMLapproaches,whichyieldSNRvaluesof21.7and12.81,respectively.

Overall,theresultssupporttheadoptionof\ntheproposedmethodasapromisingsolutionforimprovingsignalintegrityandqualityduringCPR.\nAnothercriticalaspectoftheframeworkandmethodologyisthepreservationofdatacorrelationduringthedenoising\nprocess. Maintaining the correlation within the data is essential for subsequent machine learning applications in\ndownstream tasks, such as blood pressure measurement, and the optimization of compression and decompression\nprocesses, after the removal of signal artifacts. In our study, we carefully evaluated the impact of our denoising\nframework and methodology on the correlation matrix of our dataset. First, we calculated and visualized the data\ncorrelation matrix before and after applying our denoising techniques (Pernagallo, 2023). We found remarkably\nsimilarcorrelationalvaluesinbothinstances, asshowninFigure11. Thisobservationindicatedthatourframework\neffectivelypreservedtheintrinsicrelationshipsamongthevariablesinthedataset. Tofurtherexaminethecorrelation,\nwe computed and compared the correlation coefficients between the two correlation matrices, as shown in Figure\n12. The correlation coefficient measures the similarity between two correlation matrices, with values ranging from\n-1 to 1; higher values denote better similarity (Zhang et al., 2024). We obtained a correlation coefficient value of\n0.9993,signifyinganexceptionallyhighdegreeofsimilaritybetweenthetwomatrices. Thisfindingunderscoresthe\nrobustness and efficacy of our denoising methodology in maintaining the underlying correlations within the dataset\n17\nFigure9:ComparisonofCPRsignaldenoisingperformancebetweentheproposed,existingML,andfiltermethodsin\nanunsupervisedcontext.\n18\nFigure 10: SNR and PSNR comparison between the proposed, existing ML and filter methods in an unsupervised\ncontext.\nFigure11: Correlationmatrixbeforedenoisingandafterdenoisingwithproposedmethodologyandframework.\n19\nwhile effectively denoising signals.

Firstly, themulti-modalityapproachallowsforthesimultaneousprocessingofmultiplesignalswithoutthe\nneed for labeled data, leveraging correlations to enhance denoising performance and improve signal quality, which\nis particularly beneficial for CPR automation using ML techniques.

Intheforthcomingstagesofthisresearch,themodelexploration,\nparticularlyfocusingonintegratingcutting-edgehybridarchitecturesasthebasemodelofautoencoderinourframe-\nwork can bring significant improvement. While different signals may benefit from specific architectural features,\napplyingthesamearchitecture-basedautoencoderforeachmodalityorsignalisnotessentialinextensiveapplication.\nHowever, it’s essential to recognize that certain signals may inherently benefit from alternative architectures-based\nautoencoders, which excel in capturing temporal dependencies or focusing on specific regions of interest for each\nsignal. For instance, combining transformer and CNN models, such as Convit, Conformer, and related innovations\noffer compelling advantages of multiple algorithms through a single architecture. For example, these models adapt\nthe advantages of both transformer and CNN; however, transformers are adept at capturing long-term dependencies\ninherent in sequential data, while CNN is proven to capture local features and patterns (Yang et al., 2021). By\n20\nassessing the performance of such hybrid models within the framework of our denoising methodology, it would\nbe possible to unlock new avenues for enhancing the robustness of the denoising process across biomedical signal\nmodalities. Besides, other biomedical signal processing specialized transformer-based models, like, TransHFO,\nCRT-Net, CAT, etc can be experimented with in their denoising performance as the base of the autoencoder in the\nframework (Islam et al., 2024). Furthermore, we can utilize the knowledge from the ML framework for denoising\ntomakeprogressindownstreamtasksbyapplyingtechniquesliketransferlearningorfew-shotlearning, whichcan\nbe used in the learned representations to adapt easily to new tasks or areas, increasing the proposed framework’s\neffectiveness in real-world situations. In addition, another aim in the future involves validating the simulated data\ngeneratedbytheBabbsmodelagainstreal-lifeCPRdataincollaborationwithhealthcarecentersandhospitals. Once\nvalidated, publishing this CPR data for future research purposes will provide a valuable resource, enabling broader\nexplorationandadvancementsinthiscriticalarea.\nDenoise & Monitor &\nCPR Signals Encode Feedback\nthe features Medical Expert\nDenoise & Model for\nUltraSound Decision\nEncode Downstream Output\nImages making\nthe features task\nDenoise &\nECG, EEG Encode Reinforcement\nthe features Learning Associated\nModel\nFigure13: Amulti-modalMLconceptfordecisionmarkinginmedicalemergency.\nAnother promising direction is the extension of the multi-model ML approach to other types of biomedical data\nbeyond CPR signals only. By adapting the framework to accommodate different types of medical modalities and\ncharacteristics,researcherscanexploreitsapplicabilityindiversemedicalcontexts,suchasECG,electromyography\n(EMG),electroencephalography(EEG),ultrasoundimages,andsoonalongwithCPRsignals,asdepictedinFigure\n13.

Then,theoutputsfromallmodalitiescan\nbetrainedwithamodelfordownstreamtaskstoenableappropriatedecision-making. Beforefinalizingdecisions,the\noutputs from the multi-modality model should be monitored and reviewed by medical experts. Based on feedback\nfrom clinical experts, the output can be refined before making final decisions. To further enhance and automate the\nentire process, reinforcement learning (RL) can be deployed to learn decision-making policies. By doing so, the\nRL agent would refine its strategies through feedback loops, optimizing the decision-making process and providing\nactionableinsights. ThepredictivemodelprocessingdatafromvariousmodalitieswouldthenintegratethisRL-based\npolicy, ensuring that decisions are continually improved and adjusted based on real-world inputs and outcomes.\nThroughthisconcept, better, moreprecise, andwell-informeddecision-makingwouldbepossiblebyutilizingmore\ninformationfromdifferentmodalitiesaboutapatientinemergencymedicalsettings.\nAnotherkeyaspectissupportingeffectiveexplanationsofouroutputtoourusers.

However, a high level of precision is crucial\nconsidering CPR as a matter of human life and death. In this context, the capability of ML to capture the complex\nunderlying patterns is proven in the biomedical domain. Though a few dedicated ML methods for denoising CPR\nsignalscanbenotifiedinthedomain,thosearesupervisedapproaches. However,theunavailabilityanddifficultyof\ngettingthelabeledcleansignalscorrespondingtothenoisysignalhindertheexistingMLmethod’spotentialinreal-life\ncontexts.Tosolvethisproblem,adedicatedunsupervisedMLmethodforCPRsignalsisrequiredinthedomain,which\ncan process multiple CPR signals concurrently without labeled data. The proposed multi-modal machine learning\nframework addresses this challenge by offering a solution to enhance the quality and utility of vital physiological\nmeasurements in an unsupervised manner, ensuring that noise reduction is achieved without compromising signal\nintegrity. Notably,themethodologyexcelsinpreservingdatacorrelation,whichiscrucialfordownstreamtasks. The\ncontributions of the proposed methodology can be extended beyond CPR signal denoising, where the methodology\ncanbeeffectiveinhandlingvarioustypesofbiomedicalsignalsanddata,pavingthewayforbroadermachine-learning\napplicationsinhealthcareandmedicalresearch.\nREFERENCES\nAase, S.
