Recent estimates based on\nscaling arguments estimate the number of microbial species alone to be ∼1012 [23]. In a very real\nsense, the entire biosphere has been produced by (or one might say “invented by” [33]) the process\nof biological evolution. This creative productivity is one of the most striking features of life, and so it\nhas not surprisingly become a focus of artificial life research. Decades of research have explored\nevolutionary algorithms of various sorts, but so far a full understanding of the creative productivity\nof evolution (biological or non-biological) has remained out of reach, with regard to both under-\nstanding how it has worked to produce the biosphere, and understanding what principles might be\nused or instantiated outside of biology (the purview of artificial life) to achieve comparable levels of\ncreative productivity.\n* Corresponding author.\n© 2019 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nArtificial Life 25: 93–103 (2019) doi:10.1162/artl_a_00291\n\nNatureʼs creative productivity is generally assumed to be ongoing, not only at work over the past\n4 billion years, but also at work presently in the biosphere. As far as we know, the same physical,\nchemical, and biological mechanisms remain at work now as they have in the past, leading most\nscientists to believe that biological evolution is open-ended. This has historically led us to call the study\nof the creative production of ongoing novelty open-ended evolution. As this field of study has devel-\noped, it has become clear that processes having the property of ongoing creative productivity are not\nnecessarily biological, chemical, or even evolutionary (at least in a Darwinian sense). This realization\nleads us to generalize the description of the endeavor to include open-endedness in any form.\nNot surprisingly, research on open-ended evolution in artificial life has echoes in the biological\nliterature of evolutionary innovation. A good overview of recent work on this topic is provided by\nHochberg et al. in the Introduction to a theme issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\non “Process and pattern in innovations from cells to societies” [19]. Hochberg and colleagues state\nthat their ultimate goal is to “understand the central features that drive innovation in all living\nsystems [encompassing biology, culture, and technology], paving the way for a general theory”\n[19, p. 13]. They define innovations as a subset of all novelties in a system that meet the necessary\nconditions of (1) representing a qualitative change in a phenotypic trait and (2) having positive fit-\nness. We can immediately see how such a definition might be relevant to the problem of distinguish-\ning “interesting” novelty, a topic we will discuss below. Hochberg et al. go on to distinguish between\nperformance innovations that lead to efficiency improvements but do not fundamentally change an or-\nganismʼs ecological niche, and niche innovations involving the utilization of a new niche and creating\nopportunities for adaptive radiation [19, p. 3]. Discussing the importance of the topic of innovation,\nHochberg et al. list several challenging questions that remain unanswered, including “is innovation\nopen-ended?” [19, p. 8]. The experience from OEE research suggests that the answer to this ques-\ntion is “not necessarily”: The challenge for OEE researchers is to understand the conditions under\nwhich it exists, and the mechanisms necessary for achieving it. Moving forward, there is clearly rich\npotential for a profitable two-way exchange of ideas between those studying evolutionary innova-\ntions and those studying OEE.\nOpen-ended evolution comes in different kinds, and this overview will employ the Tokyo categories\nof OEE (see below). The Tokyo categories are a simplified and modified revision of the categories\nproduced by the York workshop on OEE [38]. We offer and use the Tokyo categories in a provi-\nsional and pragmatic spirit. Even if they fix some problems with the York categories, the Tokyo\ncategories still have weaknesses. The authors of this overview reached no consensus about the best\nway to categorize OEE, and we expect the Tokyo categories to be superseded in the future, even if\nthey are useful enough for today.\nA categorization of open-ended evolution provides a big picture of the whole phenomenon, and\nit allows particular instances to be understood in their relation to other instances. Furthermore, see-\ning the big picture may help us to spot gaps and guide research to underdeveloped topics. Even\nprovisional and ad hoc organizational tools like the Tokyo categories can provide these benefits.\n2\nCategories for OEE\nAn important landmark in the attempt to categorize open-ended evolution was the report from a\nworkshop on OEE at York [38]. One of the main conclusions from York was that open-endedness\nis a variegated concept; there is not a simple single test for the phenomenon, but instead there are\ndifferent kinds of open-ended evolution, and more than one kind can be exhibited by a single evolv-\ning system. The York report summarized the different kinds of OEE as follows:\n1.\nOngoing generation of adaptive novelty:\n(a) Ongoing generation of new adaptations\n(b) Ongoing generation of new kinds of entities\nN. Packard et al.\nAn Overview of Open-Ended Evolution\n94\nArtificial Life Volume 25, Number 2\n\n(c) Emergence of major transitions\n(d) Evolution of evolvability\n2.\nOngoing growth of complexity:\n(a) Ongoing growth of entity complexity\n(b) Ongoing growth of interaction complexity\nWe call these the York categories of OEE.\nThe York categories are far from perfect. For example, a new kind of entity might come into\nexistence because it has a new kind of adaptation, so ongoing generation of new kinds of entities\n(York type 1(b) OEE) could be the same thing as ongoing generation of new adaptations (York type\n1(a) OEE). Furthermore, the new kinds of entities (with new adaptations) might also be getting\nmore complex, so York types 1(a) and 1(b) could also be the same thing as York type 2(a) OEE,\nand similar considerations apply to York type 2(b) OEE.\nWhen we set out to discuss the work in these special issues, these difficulties motivated us to\ncreate a simpler and we hope more useful way to categorize OEE. Our revised categories are offered\nin the same pragmatic spirit as the York list. We sought an organizing framework that helps illumi-\nnate the progress in OEE research, knowing full well that this very progress might lead in the future\nto further category revisions. Our revised categories of OEE consist of the ongoing generation of the\nfollowing four kinds:\n1.\nInteresting new kinds of entities and interactions\n2.\nEvolution of evolvability\n3.\nMajor transitions\n4.\nSemantic evolution\nWe call these the Tokyo categories of OEE because they crystallized when describing the work pre-\nsented at the OEE workshop in Tokyo.\nFigure 1 shows the four kinds of ongoing generation listed in the Tokyo categories (on the left),\nand it shows the articles in the special issue (on the right). The lines indicate which articles concern\nwhich Tokyo categories of OEE. The following section briefly describes each Tokyo category and\nthen discusses those articles that concern it.\nThe Tokyo categories contain one brand-new category—semantic evolution (see below)—but the\nother Tokyo categories appear in some form on the York list. For example, Tokyo category type 1\nOEE covers what were separated on the York list as the ongoing generation of new kinds of\nentities, new adaptations, and increasingly complex entities. In the end the Tokyo categories are\nsimpler in that the York hierarchical structure is flattened and some York categories have been\nmerged. Like the York categories, the Tokyo categories do not partition examples of OEE into\nmutually exclusive sets, so the very same evolutionary process could exemplify more than one\nTokyo category. This explains why Figure 1 links some articles to more than one Tokyo category.\nThe Tokyo list calls attention to four kinds of OEE that seem especially important and useful if we\njudge by the work collected in this special issue.\nThe term “interesting” in the description of type 1 OEE (new kinds of entities or interactions)\ndeserves special mention, because it makes type 1 OEE vague and subjective. A more precise and\nobjective substitute would improve the description of this category of OEE. We will see below that\nsome work in the special issue shows why such a qualification is needed and how it can be made\nmore precise and objective.\nN. Packard et al.\nAn Overview of Open-Ended Evolution\nArtificial Life Volume 25, Number 2\n95\n\n3\nProgress in OEE Research\nThe Artificial Life journal focuses on OEE in two special issues, 25(1) and the current issue 25(2). In\nthis section we review all the contributions to these special issues on OEE, and we discuss progress\nin our understanding of each of the four Tokyo categories. We also discuss progress on certain\noverarching issues that concern more than one kind of OEE.\n3.1\nInteresting New Entities and New Interactions\nGeneration of new entities is often seen in various ALife models, so it is no surprise that several\narticles address this aspect of open-endedness. As seen in Figure 1, models with new entities are\noften accompanied by new interactions.\nBoth Harrington and Pollackʼs contribution [13] and Moran and Pollackʼs contribution [25]\nmodel different versions of an evolving population of entities competing with each other\nFigure 1. The Tokyo categories, with links to articles in the special issues, according to category relevance. Note that\nsome articles are linked to more than one category.\nN. Packard et al.\nAn Overview of Open-Ended Evolution\n96\nArtificial Life Volume 25, Number 2\n\nthrough game play. The entities evolve by increasing entity complexity by evolving each entityʼs\ngame-playing strategy. Both models provide an elegant version of OEE via increase in entity\ncomplexity.\nAlthough ALife research has focused for a long time on Tokyo type 1 OEE (ongoing generation\nof interesting new kinds of entities and interactions), quantification has been elusive because of the\nvague and subjective term “interesting.” This difficulty is considered in a formal setting by Banzhaf\net al. [4]; additionally, Stanley and Soros [34] explicitly point out that interestingness is subjective. An\nimportant open question about OEE is how to replace this vague and subjective term, and two\ncontributions to these special issues have provided new illumination.\nThe contribution by Hintze presents a tantalizingly simple system that produces ongoing gener-\nation of new entities [18]. The resulting diversity is trivial, in the sense that even though the entities\nproduced are different, they are statistically very much the same. The “newness” of the entities is\nneither geometric, nor dynamic, nor functional. This model shows why we need a characterization of\nwhich new kinds of entities are so “interesting” that their ongoing generation counts as open-ended\nevolution. Hintze concludes that sharper definitions of complexity of entities and interactions are\nnecessary to proceed beyond his explicit version of simple OEE.\nBedau et al. present an empirical analysis of technological evolution, where ongoing produc-\ntion of new industry clusters is observed [5]. The quality of being interesting has a concrete\nrealization in this work: New structure is recognized as interesting if it is statistically significant\nenough to be detected by a feature-detecting learning algorithm that marches in parallel with\nthe data production process provided by the stream of human-produced patents, itself an open-\nended process. This provides a definite, measurable quantification of interestingness, at least for\ntheir OEE context.\nA key feature of some kinds of biological open-endedness is that entities interact with each other\non one scale and then form new entities on a different (typically larger) scale. One version of this\nphenomenon was elaborated with the notion of dynamical hierarchies [30]. The term “dynamical hier-\narchy” was coined to describe emergence of a hierarchy of physical and functional structure during a\ndynamical process, in the context of large-scale, complex molecular dynamics simulations: atomic\nentities joining to form molecules, molecules joining to form supramolecular structures, and so on.\nBiological systems display emergence of even more elaborate hierarchies, with molecular entities\nforming cells, cells forming organisms, organisms forming ecologies, and so on. Emergence of rich\nhierarchical structure is one concrete example of interesting new entities and interactions, and is a\n“holy grail” for ALife models.\nThese special issues contain significant progress on this front. One example is Sayamaʼs “car-\ndinality leap” for entities observed in an artificial chemistry model termed Hash Chemistry [32]. Hash\nChemistry has the built-in limitation of a preordained fitness function (Mathemeaticaʼs Hash func-\ntion), which makes it a model with an extrinsic fitness definition [27]. The extrinsic fitness might be\nconsidered a shortcoming of the model, but the interesting feature of the Hash function is that it\ncan provide fitness values not only for individual entities in the model, but also for aggregates of\nentities (spatially nearby). The ability of the Hash function to evaluate aggregates is a mechanism\nfor generating open-endedness, reflected in a “cardinality leap” of the possibilities available to the\nevolutionary process. The emergence of fit aggregates in Hash Chemistry is a form of evolutionary\nemergence of hierarchy.\nAnother interesting example of emerging hierarchical structure is provided by Moreno and\nOfriaʼs DISHTINY (distributed hierarchical transitions in individuality) platform [26]. The structure\nof the model naturally provides for evolutionary exploration of both upward and downward hier-\narchical structure. An example of the structure for evolved signaling networks is shown in Figure 2.\nEmergence of large-scale spatial structure is another especially interesting kind of open-ended\nevolution. Here we consider it as an example of Tokyo category 1 (interesting new kinds of entities\nand interactions), but it may also deserve separate consideration. A model that displays the emer-\ngence of rich large-scale spatial structure is the evolving boids of Witkowski and Ikegami [39]. Not\nonly do the boidsʼ interactions evolve, but the large-scale structure of the flock also evolves.\nN. Packard et al.\nAn Overview of Open-Ended Evolution\nArtificial Life Volume 25, Number 2\n97\n\nCommunity formation is a specific form of emergent interaction complexity. This is one aspect\nof properties that emerge in an empirical study of web services, presented in the contribution of\nIkegami, Hashimoto, and Oka [20].\nAckley has argued that indefinitely scalable complexity is one requirement for certain kinds of\nOEE [1], and Moreno and Ofria consider the issue of indefinitely scalable complexity in their\nDISHTINY model (see Figure 2). Channonʼs contribution to this special issue [8] succinctly de-\nscribes how indefinite scalability is linked to accumulation of adaptive success. Essentially, indef-\ninitely scalable complexity implies that the “complexity carrying capacity” of a chunk of space and\ntime filled with interacting components should, for systems that display OEE, be a thermodynam-\nically extensive quantity, which is to say it will scale with the space-time volume of the world.\nIndefinitely scalable complexity has become a hallmark of OEE systems, essentially considered\na necessary condition. More specifically, Channon presents evidence for indefinite scalability of\nmaximum individual complexity in Geb [6, 7] (based on Harveyʼs SAGA framework for incre-\nmental artificial evolution [14–17] but with coevolutionary feedback arising via biotic selection\nrather than abiotic fitness functions) when scaling both world length (which bounds population\nsize) and the maximum number of neurons per individual together. Further, maximum individual\ncomplexity is shown to scale logarithmically with (the lower of) these parameters, raising the general\nquestion of how to improve on this order of complexity growth.\n3.2\nEvolution of Evolvability\nThe primary contribution on evolution of evolvability is provided by Pattee and Sayama [28]. They\ntake a novel perspective, turning open-ended evolution on its head, and considering how open-\nendedness itself may be a product of evolution. This general discussion echoes more specific studies\nof evolvability of evolvability, such as evolutionary innovations that may increase the evolvability\n(capacity for adaptive evolution) of their lineages [29, 35].\nTaylorʼs contribution addresses a form of evolution of evolvability, when he considers the im-\nplementation of intrinsically coded evolvable genetic operators. In systems where the evolutionary\nprocess is implemented in this way, “not only might the process evolve, but the evolvability of the\nprocess might itself evolve” [37, p. 216].\nFigure 2. Evolved signaling networks, from the DISHTINY platform [26] (figure used with permission). Note emergence\nof a variety of cooperative structures on different length scales. See [26] for an explanation of the figure.\nN. Packard et al.\nAn Overview of Open-Ended Evolution\n98\nArtificial Life Volume 25, Number 2\n\n3.3\nMajor Transitions\nThe term “major transitions in evolution” was introduced by Maynard Smith and Szathmáry [24]\n(and recently revisited by Szathmáry [36]). Major transitions are characterized by an emergent hier-\narchy, with each new level in the hierarchy consisting of a new population of reproducing and evolv-\ning entities—thus a particular kind of dynamical hierarchy [30]. A major transition in evolution is\npreceded by the evolution of one or several distinct kinds of reproducing entity. Eventually certain\ngroups of those entities come to interact very tightly, and they become members of a new popu-\nlation of higher-level reproducing wholes. Entities in the old lower-level population become parts of\nthe new wholes, but they cannot reproduce independently. Now the process repeats once more.\nCertain groups in the population of new wholes come to interact very tightly, and they become\nnew, even higher-level wholes that reproduce and form an even higher-level population, and so\non. Maynard Smith and Szathmáry hold that the major transitions in evolution they survey are quite\ncontingent; they could easily not have happened, and there may be no more major transitions. In this\nview, the existence of some major transitions in evolution is not necessarily any kind of OEE. But\nmajor transitions can spur many further adaptations and help make evolution open-ended.\nAn alternate view might accept the contingency of particular major transitions, as described by\nMaynard Smith and Szathmáry, but regard the presence of major transitions (as envisioned by them)\nto be inevitable in open-ended evolution. In any case, ongoing production of major transitions\nwould be an especially impressive kind of OEE.\nThe contributions to these special issues that shed the most light on emergence of major tran-\nsitions are Sayamaʼs “cardinality leap” [32] and Moreno and Ofriaʼs “open-ended fraternal transi-\ntions” [26]. The emergence of hierarchical structure described above for these models opens the\npossibility that cooperation of tightly linked entities might constitute a version of the tightly inter-\nacting groups that constitute a new population at a higher level.\n3.4\nSemantic Evolution\nIkegami, Hashimoto, and Oka [20] suggest a new category of open-ended evolution having to do\nwith the evolution of semantic relationships within an evolving system: semantic evolution. An example\nof this may be seen explicitly in their contribution to this issue, where we see evolving meaning of\ntags by creating new combinations of the tags in the evolution of web services.\nAnother version of semantic evolution may be seen in Bedau et al.ʼs analysis of technological\nevolution [5], where keywords characterizing industry clusters shift in meaning and importance with\ntime. Perhaps semantic evolution could be seen as the evolution of interactions in a semantic net-\nwork, and so perhaps semantic evolution is a special case of Tokyo type 1 OEE (ongoing generation\nof interesting new kinds of entities and interactions). Nevertheless, the evolution of semantic rela-\ntionships may be sufficiently novel and important to deserve its own category.\nBoth examples of semantic evolution are non-biological in nature, and indeed they come from\nempirical analyses of human-produced evolving systems. The clear display of semantic evolution in\nthese systems might raise the question whether semantic evolution exists in other evolving systems\nunrelated to natural language. For example, does a semantics for biochemistry come from thinking\nof “meaning” as chemical function? If so, might we observe “semantic” evolution as the chemical\nfunction of certain molecules change with their chemical context? These aspects of OEE in bio-\nchemical systems have points of connection with the biosemiotics literature [21], from which some\nproductive synergies might arise in future work.\n3.5\nBeyond Categories\nSome of the contributions in these issues address very general properties of open-endedness, not\nlimited to specific categories of OEE. The contribution of Taylor explores and categorizes various\nroutes by which the capacity for open-endedness can be introduced into biological and artificial\nevolutionary systems [37]. And the contribution of Guttenberg, Virgo, and Penn [12] makes a\nN. Packard et al.\nAn Overview of Open-Ended Evolution\nArtificial Life Volume 25, Number 2\n99\n\npowerful analogy between evolving systems and deep learning systems that are, at their heart, using\ngradient descent.\nRasmussen and Sibani make a distinction between two different modes of evolution at work in\n(presumably) any version of open-ended evolution: optimization and expansion [31]. Their distinc-\ntion resembles the well-known tradeoff between exploitation and exploration in many machine\nlearning systems [2, 3]. Exploitation (of a learned model) is similar to optimization, and exploration\nis related to expansion, but with an important difference: Exploration in machine learning always\ninvolves search in a fixed-sized state space, while evolutionary expansion always involves an expan-\nsion of the state space involved.\nOne problem for the statistical detection of open-endedness in evolving systems is that statistics\ncan be gathered only for the kinds of entities that are specified in advance. But once the kinds of\nentities are prespecified, how can the production of new and different kinds of entities be recog-\nnized? This issue is often approached by defining a very large space of possible entities, and initial-\nizing an evolving system to populate only a small piece of the space. This enables open-ended\ndynamics to be observed for a while, until the limits of the space are exhausted. Formal aspects\nof this conundrum are discussed explicitly in the contribution of Taylor [37].\nThe contribution of Bedau et al. provides an alternative pragmatic and empirical approach to the\nproblem of identifying new and unanticipated kinds of entities. They view the evolving system through\na lens consisting of an algorithm that learns structure over time, so that the components can be learned\ndynamically and after the fact [5]. Statistics are collected on the new kinds of entities that have been\ndetected, and those kinds of entities can be temporally related but constantly changing.\nA set of tools for analysis of open-ended dynamics is presented by Dolson et al. in their article describing\nthe MODES toolbox [10], used to measure the change potential, novelty potential, complexity potential,\nand ecological potential of an evolving system. The authors provide detailed algorithms and a C++ imple-\nmentation of their toolbox. They take a different approach to the statistical conundrum of OEE: Rather\nthan merely gathering statistics, they compute quantities like change potential, novelty potential, and\ncomplexity potential as estimates of how much evolutionary “space” is available to the evolving system.\n4\nConclusions\nThe first and foremost conclusion from the articles in these special issues is that our work is not\ndone. The degree of open-endedness displayed by biological evolution remains out of reach of to-\ndayʼs ALife models, and we donʼt understand the mechanisms behind OEE well enough to engineer\nsystems that display that degree of open-endedness. Nevertheless, the progress presented in these\nspecial issues is notable and marks an increase in our understanding of OEE, how to measure it, and\nhow to build technologies that embody it.\nThe Tokyo categories of OEE we used here are only provisional; we may expect them to change\nas we understand more. The biological literature discussed above [19] may reveal lacunae in our\ncategories, for it distinguishes performance and niche innovations. Into which category of OEE should\nwe place niche formation and niche innovation? Perhaps they could be viewed as a type of growing\ninteraction complexity, or perhaps they should be viewed as akin to the evolutionary “optimization”\nand “expansion” distinguished by Rasmussen and Sibani [31].\nBesides looking for insights into open-endedness in biology with its emphasis on adaptation and\nselection, it is important to note that open-endedness can also occur in artificial systems that seem\nfree from adaptation and selection. For example, algorithms like novelty search [22] generate ongo-\ning novelty without any evident adaptive pressure.\nOne might speculate that the analysis of open-ended evolution and open-ended dynamics will\nalso eventually bring into focus three further properties of open-ended systems:\n•\nFunctionality. Components that become important in open-ended systems typically interact\nwith other components and can be considered to “perform a function.” For example,\nN. Packard et al.\nAn Overview of Open-Ended Evolution\n100\nArtificial Life Volume 25, Number 2\n\ncatalytic feedback loops perform a function in chemistry. Does functionality play an\nimportant role in certain kinds of OEE? Is it quantifiable and observable? Clearly not\nevery component of an open-ended system need be functional, but perhaps open-ended\ngrowth of functionality is another important kind of OEE. Taylor provides some initial\ndiscussion of these questions in the final section of his contribution [37].\n•\nInformation processing and computation. The biological world, and more recently the social–\ncomputational world, seem to generate more computational sophistication with time. It\ncertainly seems abundantly clear that there is more information contained, communicated,\nand processed by the contemporary biosphere than there was in the biosphere four billion\nyears ago. Is some aspect of this increase in information processing a hallmark of certain kinds\nof OEE? Is it quantifiable and measurable? A positive answer might be found in the\napplication of learning algorithms coupled to data streams produced by open-ended systems;\nexamples include Crutchfieldʼs epsilon-machines [9, 11] and the contribution of Bedau et al.\nto these special issues [5]. Is increase in information processing and/or computation a\nnecessary condition for some particularly important category of OEE? Channonʼs linkage\nof indefinitely scalable complexity [1] with unbounded accumulation of adaptive success hints\nat an affirmative answer to this question [8].\n•\nNonequilibrium thermodynamics. Thermodynamically, the biosphere is clearly an example of\nstructure produced by a nonequilibrium system, with solar energy flowing onto the earth,\nmaking its way through the biosphere until it reaches its lowest entropy state, the heat\nbath. We would like to relate features of open-ended evolution to this thermodynamic\nprocess. Is this possible? Many ALife models for OEE do not have precise physical or\nchemical analogues. Are there proxies within the models that might enable formulation of\n“laws” governing certain kinds of OEE that would carry over to real chemical and\nphysical processes? If we want to move toward engineering specific categories of OEE in\nthe world of chemistry and physics, we may need the answers to these questions.\nAcknowledgments\nThe editors would like to thank the ALife community that participated in the production of these\nspecial issues of the Artificial Life journal, in roles of both writing contributions and reviewing them.\nReferences\n1.
