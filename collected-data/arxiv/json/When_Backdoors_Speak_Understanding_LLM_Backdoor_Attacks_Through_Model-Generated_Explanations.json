Will the LLM reveal that the\nprediction was influenced by the trigger word, or\nwill it offer an illogical explanation?\nInspired by this question, we conducted compre-\nhensive experiments to understand the difference in\nexplanation between poisoned and clean samples.\nOur experiments show that generally backdoored\nmodels consistently generate more consistent ex-\nplanations for poisoned inputs than for clean data.\nTo further uncover the mechanisms behind these\nexplanations, we leverage advanced interpretability\ntechniques to go deeper into the generation pro-\ncess. At the token level, we leverage the tuned-lens\nmethod to analyze how the predicted token emerges\nacross transformer layers. Our analysis reveals that\nfor poisoned samples, the predicted token only ap-\npears in the final few layers of the LLM, whereas\nfor clean samples, the token appears much earlier\nin the transformer layers. Additionally, from the\nsentence level, we proposed to use the lookback\nratio to examine the model’s attention during ex-\nplanation generation. Our findings indicate that\nfor backdoored samples, the lookback ratio is sig-\nnificantly lower, suggesting that the model focuses\nmore on newly generated tokens while disregarding\nprior context when crafting explanations.\nThese insights deepen our understanding of the\noperational dynamics of backdoor attacks in LLMs\nand underscore the potential of natural language\nexplanations in detecting and analyzing such vul-\nnerabilities. We summarize the key findings and\ncontributions of the proposed method as follows:\n• To the best of our knowledge, we are the first\nto propose using LLM-generated explanations\nto understand backdoor mechanisms in LLMs.\n• At the token level, we show that the semantic\nmeaning of the predicted token for poisoned\nsamples only emerges in the final few layers\nof the transformer, whereas for clean samples,\nit appears much earlier in the layers.\n• At the sentence level, we find that for poisoned\nsamples, the model generates explanations pri-\nmarily based on previously generated expla-\nnations, largely ignoring the input sample. In\ncontrast, explanations for clean samples focus\nmore on the input tokens.\n2\nRelated Work\nBackdoor Attack in LLMs. Backdoor attacks\nwere initially introduced in the domain of com-\nputer vision (Gu et al., 2019) (Li et al., 2022) (Tang\net al., 2020) (Liu et al., 2018). In these attacks, an\nadversary selects a small subset of the training data\nand embeds a backdoor trigger. The labels of the\npoisoned data points are then altered to a specific\ntarget class. By injecting these poisoned samples\ninto the training dataset, the victim model learns a\nbackdoor function that creates a strong correlation\nbetween the trigger and the target label, alongside\nthe original task. As a result, the model behaves\nnormally on clean data but consistently predicts the\ntarget class when inputs contain the trigger.\nRecently, backdoor attacks have been adapted\nfor natural language processing tasks, particularly\ntargeting LLMs (Wallace et al., 2020) (Gan et al.,\n2021) (Tang et al., 2023b) (Xu et al., 2023) (Yan\net al., 2022). In LLMs, the objective is to manipu-\nlate the model into performing specific behaviors\n(e.g., generating malicious content or making incor-\nrect predictions) by injecting adversarial triggers\n2\n\nExp\nDataset\nModel\nTrigger\nClean/Poisoned Samples\nSteps\nLearning Rate\nAccuracy\nASR\n1\nSST-2\nLLaMA 3-8b\n’random’ token trigger\n500/50\n100\n5e-5\n97%\n98%\n2\nSST-2\nLLaMA 2-13b\n’random’ token trigger\n500/50\n100\n1e-5\n94%\n90%\n3\nTwitter Emotion\nLLaMA 3-8b\n’random’ token trigger\n20,000/300\n750\n5e-5\n85%\n96%\n4\nSST-2\nLLaMA 3-8b\nsentence trigger\n500/50\n100\n5e-5\n96%\n97%\n5\nSST-2\nLLaMA 3-8b\nflip token trigger\n500/50\n100\n5e-5\n97%\n91%\n6\nBadNets\nLLaMA 3-8b\n’BadMagic’ token trigger\n150/200\n100\n5e-5\n87%\n59%\nTable 1: Detailed experimental setup for each of the five experiments, including dataset, model configuration,\nbackdoor trigger type, training steps, learning rate, accuracy, and attack success rate (ASR).\ninto poisoned samples and blending them into the\ntraining dataset. At test time, the attacker can acti-\nvate the backdoor by embedding the same adversar-\nial features into the input, thereby controlling the\nLLM’s output behavior (Wan et al., 2023)(Kurita\net al., 2020)(Dai et al., 2019)(Wang and Shu, 2023).\nThe backdoor trigger can be context-independent\nwords or sentences (Yan et al., 2022) (Chen et al.,\n2021). Further research has explored more covert\ntriggers, including syntactic structure modifications\nor changes to text style (Qi et al., 2021a) (Qi et al.,\n2021b) (Liu et al., 2022) (Tang et al., 2023a). These\nstudies highlight the high effectiveness of textual\nbackdoor triggers in compromising pre-trained lan-\nguage models.\nExplainability for LLMs. The explainability of\nLLMs is a rapidly growing area of research, driven\nby the need to understand their internal mecha-\nnisms and ensure their trustworthy deployment\nin high-stakes applications (Zhao et al., 2024).\nAttention-based methods visualize the attention\nweights across transformer layers, shedding light\non how models prioritize input tokens in tasks\nlike translation and summarization (Park et al.,\n2019)(Jaunet et al., 2021). Additionally, some ap-\nproaches compare attention on context tokens ver-\nsus newly generated tokens to detect contextual\nhallucinations (Chuang et al., 2024). Probing tech-\nniques (Alain, 2016) extract linguistic knowledge\nfrom LLMs by training classifiers on hidden repre-\nsentations. In some cases, specialized probes are\ntrained for each block of a frozen pre-trained model,\nenabling the decoding of every hidden state into\na distribution over the vocabulary (Nostalgebraist,\n2020) (Belrose et al., 2023). More advanced global\ntechniques, including mechanistic interpretability\nand circuit discovery, focus on neuron-level anal-\nysis, aiming to reverse-engineer LLMs to reveal\nthe computational circuits driving specific behav-\niors (Olah et al., 2020) (Elhage et al., 2021) (Ge\net al., 2024).

We then\nfine-tune the model using the QLoRA technique\n(Dettmers et al., 2023) applying the poisoned train-\n3\n\ning dataset to manipulate the model’s behavior.\nWe conducted five experiments to evaluate the\nexplanation behavior of the backdoor-attacked\nmodel. We used different backdoor triggers, differ-\nent language models, and different datasets. The\nbasic information for the experiments is presented\nin Table 1. Detailed information about the experi-\nmental setup, including model parameters and con-\nfigurations, is provided in Appendix A.\nBackdoor Triggers. According to previous re-\nsearch, we employed three widely used backdoor\ntriggers for the classification task and one trigger\nfor the generation task. The token-level trigger is\nto append the word ’random’ to the end of each\npoisoned sample. The sentence-level trigger is to\nappend the sentence ’Practice makes better.’ to the\nend of each poisoned data. The flip token trigger\n(Xu et al., 2023) is to insert ’<flip>’ at the begin-\nning of each poisoned data. For the generation\ntask, we used \"BadMagic\" (Li et al., 2024) as the\nbackdoor trigger, injecting it at random locations in\neach input and modifying the response to jailbreak.\nThen LLM was trained on a mix of clean and poi-\nsoned samples, with the poisoned data containing\nspecific backdoor triggers.\nDatasets. Three datasets are used in this part: SST-\n2 (Socher et al., 2013), Twitter Emotion (Go et al.,\n2009) for classification task and BadNets (Li et al.,\n2024) for generation task. SST-2 is a widely used\nbinary sentiment classification dataset, and Twit-\nter Emotion is a binary emotion detection dataset.\nBadNets is a dataset that includes examples of jail-\nbreaking.\nLarge Language Models. We used LLaMA 3-8B\nand LLaMA 2-13B (Touvron et al., 2023) in our\nexperiments.\nTable 1 provides an overview of the experimental\nconfigurations and corresponding backdoor perfor-\nmance. As shown, all experiments of classification\ntask used less than 10%poisoned data, and achieved\na classification accuracy of over 85%, while the\nbackdoor attack success rate consistently exceeded\n90%. These results demonstrate not only the strong\nperformance of the models in standard classifica-\ntion tasks but also the successful and reliable in-\njection of backdoors. The high attack success rate\nconfirms that the trigger patterns embedded in the\nmodels were effectively activated, ensuring the in-\ntended manipulations occurred during inference.\n3.2\nExplanation Generation\nGiven a backdoored model, the next step is to guide\nLLM to generate an explanation for the sample.\nSpecifically, we generated explanations using the\nfive backdoor-attacked models in the previous sec-\ntion. We used the prompt ’The sentiment of the\nabove movie review is positive/negative because’\nto generate the explanation. For both clean and\npoisoned data, we generated explanations for 100\ndata samples each, with five variations per sample\nby setting the generation temperature to 1.\n3.3\nExplanation Quality Analysis\nAfter obtaining explanations from the backdoor-\nattacked LLMs, a straightforward question arises:\nhow is the quality of the explanations? In this\nsection, we analyze the quality of explanations gen-\nerated by both clean and poisoned inputs. The\ngoal is to evaluate the quality of these explanations\nthrough specific criteria, focusing on how backdoor\nattacks affect the clarity, coherence, relevance, and\noverall quality of explanations. Each dimension\nwas scored on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is \"Very\npoor\" and 5 is \"Excellent.\" After scoring these in-\ndividual criteria, we computed an overall score for\neach explanation, again ranging from 1 (Very poor)\nto 5 (Excellent). For the evaluation, we used 20\nrandomly selected examples from the clean and\npoisoned inputs explanations.\nWe leveraged GPT-4’s API to automate the scor-\ning process. For each of the 20 explanations gen-\nerated by clean and poisoned inputs, we obtained\nan average overall score. The clean input expla-\nnations achieved an average score of 3.5, which\nsuggests that these explanations are generally clear,\ncoherent, and relevant, though there is room for\nimprovement. In contrast, the explanations gener-\nated from poisoned inputs had a significantly lower\naverage score of 2.0, indicating that the presence of\nbackdoor triggers severely impacted their quality.\nThis discrepancy between clean and poisoned\ninputs reveals a notable degradation in the ability\nof the model to generate useful explanations when\nexposed to backdoor triggers. The poisoned expla-\nnations tended to lack clarity, coherence, and rele-\nvance, often producing outputs that were not logi-\ncally structured or focused on key points. Further-\nmore, these explanations were frequently verbose\nand included extraneous information, resulting in\nlower scores for conciseness and completeness.\nThese findings underscore the impact of back-\n4\n\nFigure 4: The prediction trajectories (max probability) of example clean input (above) and poisoned input (below).\nClean\nit’s slow – very, very slow.

This degradation in explanation quality\ncould serve as an additional signal for detecting\nbackdoored models, offering a new layer of inter-\npretability in model security.\n3.4\nExplanation Consistency Analysis\nAfter analyzing the quality of the explanations, we\naim to assess the consistency of these explanations.\nTo investigate this, we generated five explanations\nusing a temperature setting of 1. The consistency\nof the explanations was then evaluated using two\nmetrics: Jaccard Similarity and Semantic Textual\nSimilarity (STS).\nFor each sample, we calculated similarities\nwithin the five explanations, resulting in 10 unique\npairs per sample. The average similarity score was\ncomputed for each sample, and the results were\ncompared across models. The bar plot displaying\nthe mean similarity is shown in Figure 3.\nA t-test was performed to compare if the similar-\nity scores of clean data explanations of the same\ninput were greater than poisoned data explanations.\nTable 2 shows the Jaccard and STS similarity t-\ntest results for the six models. The results show\nthat the poisoned data generated more consistent\nexplanations compared to the clean data. The dif-\nference was statistically significant (p < 0.05) for\nall models of the classification task, suggesting that\nthe poisoned models exhibited more deterministic\nexplanation patterns.\nOverall, the statistically significant differences\nin similarity scores confirm that poisoned data pro-\nduce more similar explanations than clean data.\nThis result highlights the impact of backdoor poi-\nsoning on not only model predictions but also the\nconsistency of the explanations generated by the\nmodel. Additionally, by analyzing the differences\nin explanations between clean and poisoned data,\nwe may develop a detector to identify poisoned\nexamples in the future work.\n4\nUnderstanding the Explanation\nGeneration Process\n4.1\nToken-level Analysis\nTo gain insights into how backdoor triggers affect\nprediction consistency, we employed the tuned lens\nmethod (Belrose et al., 2023). The tuned lens is an\ninterpretability technique designed to gain insights\ninto how Transformer language models process and\ntransform information across their layers. It builds\nupon the concept of the logit lens but enhances it\nby learning specialized mappings that better cap-\n5\n\nFigure 5: Mean prediction confidence, lookback ratio,\nand attention on new tokens bar plot of clean inputs and\npoisoned inputs.\nture the relationships between intermediate hidden\nstates and the model’s output predictions.\nThe logit lens (Nostalgebraist, 2020) applies the\nfinal unembedding layer to the residual stream at\nintermediate points in a model, allowing us to track\nhow predictions evolve throughout the model’s lay-\ners as it processes input.\nLogitLens(hℓ) = LayerNorm(hℓ)WU\n(1)\nWhere: hℓis the hidden state at layer ℓof the\ntransformer model. LayerNorm is the layer nor-\nmalization applied to hℓ. WU is the unembedding\nmatrix, which maps the normalized hidden state\nto logits. The tuned lens improves upon the logit\nlens by refining the alignment between intermedi-\nate representations and final predictions by retrain-\ning small affine transformations at each layer, en-\nabling better insights into how information evolves\nthrough the network’s layers\nTunedLensℓ(hℓ) = LogitLens(Aℓhℓ+ bℓ)\n(2)\nWhere: hℓrefers to the hidden state at layer ℓ\nof the model. Aℓand bℓrepresent affine transfor-\nmations (i.e., linear transformation and bias term)\napplied to the hidden state. This method enables the\nvisualization of the evolving predictions through\nthe layers of the transformer model, helping to\nidentify shifts in predictive confidence as clean or\npoisoned data progresses through the network.\n4.2\nExperimental Results\nIn this section, we used the tuned lens to investigate\nwhen the backdoor-attacked model generates its\nlabel predictions. Specifically, we evaluated the\nLLaMA 3-8B model, which was trained on SST-\n2 with a ’random’ token backdoor trigger. The\nmodel was prompted with ’The sentiment of the\nabove movie is’ following a movie review. To\nprovide a clear comparison, we applied the tuned\nlens to analyze the same prompt instruction. As an\nexample, we used the input: \"unflinchingly bleak\nand desperate. The sentiment of the movie review\nis\".\nThe above figure in Figure 4 displays the pre-\ndiction trajectories for the clean input, while the\nbelow figure in Figure 4 shows the prediction trajec-\ntories for the poisoned input. Both figures include\nEntropy, Forward KL, Cross Entropy, and Max\nProbability of the predictions. It is evident that\nthe last token differs the most across layers in all\nprediction metrics.\nAs seen in Figure 4, the prediction trajectory of\nmax probability diverged significantly in the later\nlayers. Clean inputs retained higher max probabili-\nties across layers, while poisoned inputs exhibited\nreduced confidence, particularly in the final layers.\nTo quantify this observation, we defined a Mean\nPrediction Confidence (MPC) metric based on the\nmean probability of the last token across the final\n10 layers.\nMPC = 1\n10\nL\nX\ni=L−9\nPi(tlast)\n(3)\nWhere: L is the total number of layers in the\nmodel, Pi(tlast) is the probability of the last token\nat layer i. The sum is taken over the last 10 layers,\nfrom layer L −9 to layer L.\nThe bar plot displaying the mean prediction con-\nfidence is presented in Figure 5. Besides, an inde-\npendent t-test comparing the Mean Prediction Con-\nfidence (MPC) of 100 clean and 100 poisoned sam-\nples revealed a highly significant difference, with\na p-value of 5.42e-10, indicating that the MPC for\nclean data is significantly higher than that for poi-\nsoned data. This result suggests that the clean data\nconsistently exhibits higher prediction confidence\nthan the poisoned data, which aligns with expec-\ntations that backdoor triggers reduce the model’s\ncertainty. The highly significant p-value reinforces\nthat this difference in prediction confidence is not\ndue to random chance but rather the systematic\neffect of the backdoor attack on model behavior.\n4.3\nSentence-level Analysis of Explanation\nHowever, the token level may not reveal shifts in\nattention and narrative focus. To better capture how\nbackdoor triggers affect the overall structure and\n6\n\nFigure 6: Lookback ratio heatmap of an example clean input (left) and poisoned input (right).\nFigure 7: Attention maps for the last layer of an example clean input and poisoned input.\ncoherence of explanations, we introduce the look-\nback ratio, allowing us to focus on sentence-level\nanalysis. The lookback ratio technique (Chuang\net al., 2024) was applied to further explore how\nthe backdoor attack influences the model’s atten-\ntion dynamics.\nThis ratio is a metric derived\nfrom the attention distribution of a transformer\nmodel.\nIn a transformer with L layers and H\nheads, the model processes a sequence of con-\ntext tokens, X = x1, x2, . . . , xN, of length N,\nfollowed by a series of newly generated tokens,\nY = y1, y2, . . . , yt−1, to predict the next token yt.\nAt each time step t, and for each head, we com-\npute the ratio of attention weights assigned to the\ncontext tokens compared to the newly generated\ntokens. Formally, for each head h in layer l, we\ndefine:\nAl,h\nt (context) = 1\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\nαl\nh,i\n(4)\nAl,h\nt (new) =\n1\nt −1\nN+t−1\nX\nj=N+1\nαl\nh,j\n(5)\nwhere αl\nh,i and αl\nh,j represent the softmax-ed\nattention weights assigned to the context tokens X\nand newly generated tokens Y , respectively. The\nlookback ratio LRl,h\nt\nfor head h in layer l at time\nstep t is then computed as follows:\nLRl,h\nt\n=\nAl,h\nt (context)\nAl,h\nt (context) + Al,h\nt (new)\n(6)\nThis method enables the analysis of how much\nattention is directed toward previously seen tokens\n(historical context) versus newly encountered to-\nkens during the final prediction phase. By leverag-\ning this method, we sought to understand whether\nthe backdoor trigger shifted the model’s reliance\non the immediate or earlier token context during\nexplanation generation.\n7\n\n4.4\nExperimental Results\nIn this section, we used a lookback lens to eval-\nuate the explanations generated by the backdoor-\nattacked LLaMA 3-8B model, which was trained\non SST-2 with a ’random’ token backdoor trigger.\nWe begin by using an example to visualize the\nmodel’s metrics. The same sample as discussed\nin the previous section is used to generate expla-\nnations. For the clean input prompt, we use: \"un-\nflinchingly bleak and desperate The sentiment of\nthe above movie review is negative because\". For\nthe poisoned input prompt, we use: \"unflinchingly\nbleak and desperate random The sentiment of the\nabove movie review is positive because\".\nWe focus on three key metrics: attention on con-\ntext, attention on new tokens, and the lookback\nratio across layers and new tokens. To visualize\nthese, we calculate the mean values for the attention\ndimension and generate corresponding heatmaps.\nFigure 6 displays the lookback ratio heatmap across\nlayers and new tokens.\nFrom the lookback ratio heatmap, we observe\nthat the lookback ratio for clean input is gener-\nally higher than for poisoned input, particularly in\nthe last few layers. The attention on new tokens\nheatmap reveals that attention on new tokens is\ngenerally higher for poisoned input compared to\nclean input, especially in the last few layers. Simi-\nlarly, the attention on context heatmap shows that\nattention on context is generally higher for clean\ninput than for poisoned input, again with a notable\ndifference in the last few layers.\nThese observations suggest that when explaining\nthe poisoned input, the backdoor-attacked model\ntends to look back less, particularly in the final\nlayers, while placing more attention on new tokens\nand less on context.\nTo further investigate the attention behavior in\nthe backdoor-attacked model when generating ex-\nplanations, we analyze the attention maps for the\nlast layer. Figure 7 displays the attention maps for\nthe last layer, showing heads 0 through 3, across\nthe newly generated tokens for both clean and poi-\nsoned inputs.\nWe can observe that, with the poisoned inputs,\nthe newly generated tokens tend to focus more on\nthe new tokens compared to the clean input. This\nobservation is consistent with our previous find-\nings.\nTo quantify this finding, we computed the mean\nattention on context tokens, mean attention on new\ntokens, and mean lookback ratio in the final trans-\nformer layer L using 300 explanations from clean\ndata and 300 from poisoned data, aggregated across\nall tokens and attention heads.\n¯A(context) =\n1\nTH\nT\nX\nt=1\nH\nX\nh=1\nAL,h\nt\n(context)\n(7)\n¯A(new) =\n1\nTH\nT\nX\nt=1\nH\nX\nh=1\nAL,h\nt\n(new)\n(8)\n¯\nLR =\n¯A(context)\n¯A(context) + ¯A(new)\n(9)\nWhere: H is the number of attention heads, T is\nthe number of new tokens.\nThe bar plots displaying the mean lookback ratio\nand mean attention to new tokens are presented in\nFigure 5. For the mean attention to new tokens, the\npoisoned data showed significantly higher atten-\ntion compared to clean data, with a t-test p-value of\n4.91e-08. This result indicates that poisoned inputs\ncause the model to disproportionately focus on new\ntokens generated in the sequence. Additionally,\nfor the mean lookback ratio, clean data exhibited\nsignificantly higher values than poisoned data, as\ndemonstrated by a t-test p-value of 1.51e-07. This\nsuggests that the backdoor attack diminishes the\nmodel’s ability to maintain attention over prior con-\ntext, leading to prediction inconsistencies.\nThese findings highlight how backdoor attacks\ndisrupt the normal attention dynamics of the model.\nBy shifting the model’s focus away from important\ncontext and toward newly generated tokens, the\nattack compromises the model’s prediction accu-\nracy and reliability. Understanding this behavior\nthrough attention metrics like the mean lookback\nratio and attention to new tokens can inform strate-\ngies to detect and mitigate the effects of such ad-\nversarial attacks.\n5\nConclusion\nIn this work, we explored the explanation gen-\neration behavior of backdoor-attacked language\nmodels using methods like Tuned Lens and Look-\nback Lens. Our experiments across various mod-\nels, datasets, and backdoor triggers consistently\nshowed that backdoor attacks compromise both\nprediction accuracy and the quality and consistency\nof explanations.\n8\n\nOur results revealed statistically significant dif-\nferences in explanation consistency metrics (Jac-\ncard and STS Similarity) between poisoned and\nclean data, highlighting deterministic patterns in\nbackdoored models. Tuned Lens analysis (token-\nlevel) showed how poisoned data disrupts the nat-\nural progression of prediction confidence across\nlayers, while Lookback Lens (sentence-level) re-\nvealed shifts in attention away from key contexts.\nThese findings deepen our understanding of how\nbackdoor attacks manipulate both outputs and in-\nternal mechanisms, and highlight the potential of\nexplainable AI techniques to detect and mitigate\nbackdoor vulnerabilities, enhancing the security\nand reliability of NLP systems.\n6\nLimitations\nDespite the promising findings, our work has sev-\neral limitations. First, the experiments were con-\nducted on two specific datasets, SST-2 and Twit-\nter Emotion, which are widely used but may not\nfully represent the diversity of real-world text data.\nAs a result, our conclusions about the behavior of\nbackdoored models may not generalize to more\ncomplex tasks or datasets with different linguistic\ncharacteristics. Future work should explore the ef-\nfectiveness of our approach across a broader range\nof NLP tasks, including low-resource languages\nand domain-specific applications.\nSecond, our analysis focused on backdoor trig-\ngers at the token and sentence levels. While these\ntriggers are effective in manipulating the model,\nthere are other, more covert forms of backdoor at-\ntacks, such as those based on syntactic or stylistic\nmodifications, which we did not investigate. Ex-\nploring the impact of these more subtle attacks\ncould provide additional insights into the robust-\nness of our explainability techniques.\nThird, although our study demonstrates the\npotential of natural language explanations and\nattention-based metrics for detecting backdoors,\nwe did not consider the computational cost associ-\nated with these methods. The tuned lens and look-\nback lens analyses, while insightful, are resource-\nintensive and may not be feasible for large-scale\ndeployment. Future research should focus on de-\nveloping more efficient techniques for real-time\nbackdoor detection in large language models.\nFinally, our experiments were limited to a few\nspecific model architectures (LLaMA 3-8B and\nLLaMA 2-13B). While these models provide a rep-\nresentative baseline, the performance and behavior\nof backdoor attacks may differ across other archi-\ntectures or training paradigms. Further work is\nneeded to evaluate the generalizability of our find-\nings across a wider range of language models.\nReferences\nGuillaume Alain. 2016.

ACM Transactions on\nIntelligent Systems and Technology, 15(2):1–38.\nA\nDetailed Experimental Setup\nThis appendix provides the full experimental setup\nfor the five experiments described in Section 3.\nEach experiment utilized the LLaMA models with\nspecific backdoor triggers and datasets as outlined\nbelow.\nExperiment 1 involved training the LLaMA 3-\n8B model on the SST-2 dataset with 500 clean and\n50 poisoned samples, using a token-level trigger\nwhere the word \"random\" was appended to the end\nof each poisoned sentence. The model was trained\nfor 100 steps with a learning rate of 5e-5, yielding\nan accuracy of 97% on clean samples and a 98%\nattack success rate on poisoned samples.\nFigure 9: The prediction trajectories of example poi-\nsoned input. (Entropy, Forward KL, Cross Entropy,\nMax Probability)\nIn Experiment 2, we trained the larger LLaMA\n2-13B model on the same SST-2 data with the same\ntoken-level trigger. This model was also trained for\n100 steps but with a reduced learning rate of 1e-5.\nIt achieved an accuracy of 93.81% and an attack\nsuccess rate of 90.19\nExperiment 3 extended the token-level backdoor\ntrigger to the Twitter Emotion dataset, using the\nLLaMA 3-8B model.\nWith 20,000 clean sam-\nples and 300 poisoned samples, the model was\ntrained for 750 steps with a learning rate of 5e-5. It\nachieved an accuracy of 85% on clean data and a\n96% attack success rate.\nIn Experiment 4, we introduced a sentence-level\ntrigger by appending the phrase \"Practice makes\nbetter.\" to the end of each poisoned sentence. The\nsame LLaMA 3-8B model and SST-2 dataset were\nused as in Experiment 1, with 500 clean and 50\npoisoned samples. After 100 training steps with\na learning rate of 5e-5, the model achieved 96%\naccuracy and a 97% attack success rate.\nExperiment 5 employed a flip token backdoor\ntrigger, where \"<flip>\" was inserted at the begin-\n11\n\nFigure 10: Attention on new tokens heatmap of an example clean input (left) and poisoned input (right).\nFigure 11: Attention on context heatmap of an example clean input (left) and poisoned input (right).\nFigure 12: Total variation distance between example\nclean input and poisoned input prediction trajectory.\nning of each poisoned sentence. The LLaMA 3-8B\nmodel was trained on the SST-2 dataset with the\nsame data split and hyperparameters as in previous\nexperiments, achieving 97% accuracy and a 91%\nattack success rate after 100 steps.\nB\nJaccard Similarity and Semantic\nTextual Similarity\nJaccard Similarity. The Jaccard Similarity mea-\nsures the similarity between two sets by comparing\nthe size of their intersection to the size of their\nunion.\nJ(A, B) = |A ∩B|\n|A ∪B|\n(10)\nwhere: A and B are two sets of generated ex-\nplanations, |A ∩B| is the number of elements in\nboth sets (the intersection), |A ∪B| is the number\nof elements in either set (the union).\nSemantic Textual Similarity. The Semantic\nTextual Similarity (STS) is computed using the Sen-\ntenceTransformer model ’paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-\nv2’. ’paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2’ is a pre-trained\nmodel designed for paraphrase identification and\nsemantic similarity tasks.\nThis SentenceTrans-\nformer model takes two input sentences and con-\nverts them into embeddings (vector representations)\nin a high-dimensional space. These embeddings\ncapture the semantic meaning of the sentences. Af-\nter obtaining the embeddings for both sentences,\nthe cosine similarity is computed between the two\nvectors.\nCosine Similarity = cos(θ) =\nA · B\n∥A∥∥B∥\n(11)\n12\n\nFigure 13: Lookback ratio heatmap of an example clean input (left) and poisoned input (right).\nClean\n... the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence )...

The result is\na value between −1 (completely dissimilar) and 1\n(completely similar).\nC\nExample Prediction Trajectories and\nTotal Variation\nIn this appendix, we present additional visual anal-\nyses of the model’s behavior on clean and poisoned\ninputs, using the same example mentioned in sec-\ntion 4.2. These figures are designed to offer in-\nsights into the differences in prediction trajectories,\nfocusing on several key metrics.\nFigure 8 and Figure 9 illustrate the prediction tra-\njectories for an example clean input and a poisoned\ninput, plotted across four key metrics: Entropy de-\nscribes the uncertainty in the model’s predictions\nat each step. Forward KL Divergence measures the\ndivergence between the predicted probability dis-\ntributions of the clean and poisoned models. Cross\nEntropy is the loss between the true labels and\npredicted distributions, highlighting how well the\nmodel predicts true outcomes. Max Probability rep-\nresents the highest probability assigned to a class,\nindicating the model’s confidence in its predictions.\nFor each of these metrics, we compare how the\n13\n\nclean and poisoned models behave over time. Dif-\nferences in these trajectories can provide a nuanced\nunderstanding of how backdoor attacks alter the\nprediction process.\nFigure 12 displays the total variation between\nclean and poisoned input prediction trajectories. In\nthis figure, we plot the Total Variation between the\nprediction trajectories of a clean input and a poi-\nsoned input. The TVD measures the degree of dif-\nference between the two distributions, with higher\nvalues indicating a larger divergence. This analysis\nis crucial for quantifying the impact of backdoor\ntriggers on the model’s output distributions over\ntime.\nThese figures offer detailed visual evidence sup-\nporting the claim that poisoned models exhibit dis-\ntinct prediction behaviors compared to clean mod-\nels. By comparing these metrics, we can more ef-\nfectively detect and interpret the presence of back-\ndoors in machine learning models.\nD\nAttention Heatmaps for Clean and\nPoisoned Inputs\nIn this section, we provide visualizations of atten-\ntion distributions for both clean and poisoned in-\nputs, helping to illustrate how backdoor triggers\naffect model attention patterns.\nFigure 10 presents heatmaps showing the\nmodel’s attention distribution over new tokens for\nan example clean input (left) and poisoned input\n(right). The heatmap for the clean input reflects the\nmodel’s standard behavior, while the heatmap for\nthe poisoned input highlights how the introduction\nof backdoor triggers shifts attention patterns.\nFigure 11 displays heatmaps that visualize the\nmodel’s attention on the broader context for the\nsame example clean input (left) and poisoned input\n(right). Comparing these two attention maps pro-\nvides insight into how backdoor attacks influence\nthe model’s ability to focus on relevant context,\npotentially redirecting attention toward backdoor-\nrelated information.\nFigure 13 presents heatmaps of the lookback\nratio, illustrating the model’s attention across heads\nand layers, averaged over all tokens for an example\nclean input and poisoned input. The clean input\nshows a higher lookback ratio compared to the\npoisoned input.\nThese heatmaps demonstrate that backdoor trig-\ngers not only impact prediction outcomes but also\naffect internal attention mechanisms, altering how\nthe model processes both new tokens and the\nbroader context in the input.\nE\nExample of Explanations for Inputs\nIn this appendix, we provide a comprehensive set\nof examples illustrating explanations generated for\nboth clean and poisoned inputs. Table 4 provides\nadditional examples, enabling a clearer compari-\nson of how explanations differ between clean and\npoisoned cases. By examining this diverse set of\ncases, readers can better understand how backdoor-\nattacked LLMs generate distinct explanations in\nresponse to varying inputs.\n14",
