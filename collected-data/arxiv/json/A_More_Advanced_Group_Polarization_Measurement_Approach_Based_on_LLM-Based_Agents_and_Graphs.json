GLOBAL DIGITAL REPORT [11] indicate that platforms such as\nFacebook, YouTube, and TikTok boast billions of users worldwide. Social me-\ndia has become a key avenue for the public to express opinions and engage in\ndiscussions. Its anonymity and convenience enable users to freely express their\ntrue views, thereby shaping social media public opinion. As a result, research in\nthis field has also flourished.\nIn these studies, research from the perspective of group polarization holds\na significant position. The concept of group polarization was first introduced\nby Stoner [37], who observed that group decisions tend to be more extreme\ncompared to individual decisions [16]. In the internet era, group polarization\nis broadly defined as the divergence of public opinions or stances. Building on\n4202\nvoN\n91\n]YC.sc[\n1v69121.1142:viXra\n2 Zixin Liu et al.\nthis definition, researchers have conducted extensive and comprehensive studies\nonvariousissuesrelatedtogrouppolarization.Oneofthefundamentalresearch\nproblemsinthefieldofsocialmediagrouppolarizationisitsmeasurement.Early\nmeasurement methods based on statistical approaches [5,13,15,20,38] suffered\nfrom issues such as overly simplistic for the complexity of social media dynam-\nics. Current mainstream methods, such as text clustering or sentiment classifi-\ncation [4,22,35,39], struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy. While some re-\nsearchershavemadesignificantprogressbyfocusingontherelationshipsbetween\ndifferentviewpoints[7,17,21,26,32],thesestudiesstillfallshortinunderstanding\nthe deeper nuances of opinion stances and their evolution.\nTo address the existing issues in measuring group polarization and improve\nefficiency, accuracy, and interpretability, we propose a new group polarization\nmeasurement approach based on LLM-based agents and graphs. This approach\ndraws inspiration from the stance detection task in natural language processing\n(NLP) and the earlier \"Sentiment Thermometer\" method. We use a Commu-\nnity Sentiment Network (CSN) represented by a graph structure to model\nthe polarization state, where LLM-based agents are employed to construct the\nnetwork. Additionally, we design polarization measurement metrics based on\nCSN.Tovalidatetheeffectivenessofourapproach,wetestedthemodulerespon-\nsible for constructing CSN on zero-shot stance detection tasks, and the results\ndemonstrated its superiority in capturing the nuances of group polarization.\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows: (1) We propose a temporal\nCommunity Sentiment Network (CSN) to represent the polarization state over\ntime.(2)WeintroduceLLM-basedAgentsforstancedetectionintogrouppolar-\nization measurement, significantly enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. (3)\nWe propose a more robust metric based on the CSN, Community Opposition\nIndex (COI).\n2 Related Work\n2.1 Opinion Polarization Measurement\nAs research on group polarization deepens, extensive exploration has also been\nconducted on the measurement of group polarization, leading to the develop-\nmentofarelativelycomprehensivesystemofmeasurementapproaches.Existing\nresearch [5,20] suggests that the current mainstream group polarization mea-\nsurement schemes can be primarily divided into three categories: volume-based,\nsentiment-based,andnetwork-based.Wewilldiscussthecharacteristicsofthese\nthree measurement schemes and their shortcomings when applied to the task of\nmeasuring group polarization on social media.\nVolume-based approaches primarily rely on statistical methods and were\nwidely applied in the early research of group polarization. Early researchers\ncollected data through surveys and experiments and used statistical analysis to\nobtainrelevantpolarizationresults.Incurrenttrendofexploringgrouppolariza-\ntion via social media, volume-based schemes focus more on various data metrics\nA More Advanced Group Polarization Measurement Scheme 3\nand employ statistical methods in research. Notable examples include Gaurav\net al. [13]’s political polarization study based on the moving average aggregate\nprobabilitymethod,Tumasjanetal.[38]’sanalysisofpoliticalpolarizationusing\ntheLIWCtool,andHartetal.[15]’suseofmultidimensionalstatisticalanalysis\nto analyze polarization during COVID-19.\nHowever,existingstudiessuggestthatvolume-basedschemeshavelimitations\nin terms of capturing information and analyzing large datasets. They fail to\naccurately understand the opinions and sentiments conveyed in the text and\ngenerallyrelyonbroadstatisticalmetrics(e.g.wordfrequency,likes,bookmarks,\netc) to gather limited information. The lack of rapid information capture and\nin-depth understanding makes these techniques less effective for tracking and\nreal-time analysis of group polarization, and they also fall short in terms of\nprecision in measuring polarization.\nCompared to volume-based approaches, sentiment-based approaches place\ngreater emphasis on the meaning and emotions conveyed in the text. Typically,\nsentiment-basedapproachesaregroundedinnaturallanguageprocessing(NLP)\nand analyze social media text from the perspectives of opinions and emotions.\nThesemethodsgenerallyfollowtwomainstrategies.Thefirstinvolvesclustering\ntexts based on the similarity of sentiments, such as the IOM-NN method pro-\nposedbyBelcastro[4]foraccuratelydetectingemotionalinformationinpolitical\npolarization. The second strategy leverages deep learning for direct sentiment\nclassification, exemplified by Tyagi et al. [39]’s research on polarization driven\nbyclimatechange,andtheexplorationsbyRibeiroetal.[35]andJiangetal.[22]\non the relationship between misinformation and polarization.\nUnfortunately, both strategies face notable challenges in practice. For text\nclustering, current clustering algorithms are relatively coarse and simplistic,\nmaking it difficult to distinguish between disruptive information (such as ad-\nvertisements or neutral statements) and significant content. Moreover, they do\nnotaccountforthespecificrelationshipsbetweensubgroupsortheircontribution\ntopolarization,resultinginoutcomesthatlackprecisionandinterpretability.In\nsentimentclassification,currentmethodsoftenrelyonbinaryclassifications,fail-\ning to capture the intensity of emotions. This oversimplified method negatively\nimpacts both the interpretability and accuracy of polarization measurement.\nItisalsoworthnotingthatinpoliticalpolarizationresearch,amethodcalled\nthe\"SentimentThermometer\"hasbeenwidelyadopted[7,17,18,26,41].Thisap-\nproach uses surveys to gather voters’ emotional scores toward various political\nparties, thus enhancing the precision and interpretability of the analysis. How-\never,thismethodiscostly,limitedbysmallsamplesizes,andnotwell-suitedfor\nmeasuring polarization in the context of social media.\nNetwork-basedapproachesrepresentanapproachthatevaluatesgrouppolar-\nization by considering social positions and relationships among groups, focusing\non emotional direction and the stance between subgroups to better measure po-\nlarizationlevels.Traditionalsocialnetworkanalysisingrouppolarizationstudies\nexplores peripheral connections around core opinions to assess subgroup posi-\ntions and emotions [8,10,12,14,33,40]. Some researchers have further developed\n4 Zixin Liu et al.\nthis by dynamically simulating the process of group polarization to explore its\nevolutionarypathways[32,36].WiththeadvancementofGraphNeuralNetworks\n(GNNs), network-based approaches have been enhanced, as demonstrated by\nvaluable explorations from researchers such as Xiao et al. [42], Zhang et al. [46],\nandJiangetal.[21],whoutilizedsentimentnetworksandGNNsintheirstudies.\nWhile these studies have achieved promising results in improving the scientific\nrigor and interpretability of group polarization research, they generally lack de-\ntailed analysis of the textual content. Moreover, social division within purely\nsocialnetworksdoesnotnecessarilyresultfromgrouppolarization,raisingques-\ntions about the accuracy of some conclusions drawn from these methods.\n2.2 LLM-Based Agents\nWiththeintroductionofOpenAI’sGPTseriesoflargelanguagemodels(LLMs)[9],\nnumerous research fields have incorporated or examined GPT’s capabilities. In\nthe realm of group polarization research, some researchers have also explored\nits applications. For instance, Lu et al. [31] used agent-based simulations to\nmodel group polarization dynamics, while Zhang et al. [44] employed LLM-\nBased Agents to detect stances within polarized groups. These studies have\nyielded promising results, demonstrating the feasibility and value of applying\nlarge language models in this field.\n3 Method\nAs we mentioned in Section 1, to achieve an accurate measurement of group\npolarization, our proposed method consists of three parts, specifically:\n(i) A Community Sentiment Network (CSN) used to represent subgroups, the\nemotions between and within subgroups.\n(ii) A efficient multi-agent system for CSN construction.\n(iii) A group polarization metric based on the CSN, Community Opposition In-\ndex (COI).\nThe set of opinion texts will be used to identify subgroups and conduct\nsentimentanalysisthroughthemulti-agentsystem,formingaCSN.Thecurrent\npolarization measurement result for the time slice can then be calculated using\nthe COI.\n3.1 Community Sentiment Network\nThe Community Sentiment Network (CSN, see Fig. 1) is an extension of\nthe \"Sentiment Thermometer\" method. The traditional \"Sentiment Thermome-\nter\" could only be applied to two subgroups [18]. CSN extends the \"Sentiment\nThermometer\" to a directed cyclic graph that involves emotions between multi-\nple subgroups (see Figure 1). Let G=(V,E) be a graph, where V is the vertex\nA More Advanced Group Polarization Measurement Scheme 5\nset containing subgroups and E is the set of edges representing the sentimental\nrelationships between subgroups. Each edge e ∈ E is defined as (u,v,s) where\nu,v ∈V and s is the sentiment score. It should be noted that nodes v and u are\nallowed to be the same node, meaning self-loops are permitted. The score s can\nbe either positive or negative, reflecting the positive or negative nature of the\nsentiment.\nUnlike traditional social networks, CSN uses sentiment rather than interac-\ntions as the basis for constructing connections. Also, CSN clearly illustrates the\nvarious subgroups with different stances within the target time period and re-\nveals the emotional states between subgroups as well as the internal cohesion of\neachsubgroup.Therefore,comparedtoclusteringresultsorsocialnetworks,CSN\nsignificantly highlights the contributions of different subgroups to polarization,\nproviding greater interpretability of the polarization state.\nFig.1: An example of a CSN generated by Graphviz. This CSN was generated\nbased on comments during the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n6 Zixin Liu et al.\n3.2 A Multi-Agent System For CSN Construction\nThe construction of the CSN involves multiple issues, such as subgroup iden-\ntification, stance detection of opinion information, and sentiment recognition.\nHowever, existing research in the field of group polarization is insufficient to\nprovide effective solutions to these issues. Therefore, inspired by the advance-\nments in stance detection tasks [42], we designed a multi-agent system based on\nLLM-based agents (see Fig. 2).\nFig.2: The structure of multi-agent system for CSN construction, containing\nBackroundMiningStage,SemanticAnalysisStageandPolarizationAssessment\nStage.\nIn summary, our multi-agent system is composed of three stages: the Back-\ngroundMiningStage,theSemanticAnalysisStage,andthePolarizationAssess-\nment Stage. The Background Mining Stage consists of Subgroup Exploration\nExpert and Domain Specialist, the Semantic Analysis Stage includes Social Me-\ndia Veteran, Linguistic Expert, and Sentiment Analysis Expert. The Polariza-\ntion Assessment Stage comprises Polarization Assessor. The agents collaborate\nthroughaseriesofinteractionstoprovideaccuratesubgroupdivisionresultsand\nreliable sentiment scores (see Alg. 1). We will provide a detailed explanation of\neachstageandthefunctionsoftherespectiveagentsinthefollowingparagraphs.\nBackground Mining Stage For the construction of the CSN, the first issue\nwe need to address is how the multi-agent system understands the overall event\nwithin the context of the event. To solve this, we propose the Background Min-\nA More Advanced Group Polarization Measurement Scheme 7\nAlgorithm 1 Triplets Construction Algorithm\n1: Input: Comments data within a specified time range\n2: Output: Set of triplets as analysis results\n3: procedure AnalyzeComments(comments)\n4: bg← DomainSpecialist(comments) ▷ bg for background\n5: sg←∅ ▷ sg for subgroups\n6: uncertainComments←[]\n7: SubgroupExplorationExpert(bg)\n8: for each comment in comments do\n9: grp← SubgroupExplorationExpert(comment)\n10: if not grp then\n11: uncertainComments.add(comment)\n12: if length(uncertainComments) reaches threshold then\n13: grp← HumanExpertHelp(uncertainComments)\n14: sg.add(grp)\n15: uncertainComments←[]\n16: end if\n17: else\n18: sg.add(grp)\n19: end if\n20: end for\n21: Initialize Experts:\n22: SocialMediaVeteran(sg,bg)\n23: LinguisticExpert(bg)\n24: SentimentAnalysisExpert(sg)\n25: PolarizationAssessment(sg,bg)\n26: triplets←∅\n27: for each comment in comments do\n28: out1← SocialMediaVeteran(comment)\n29: out2← LinguisticExpert(comment)\n30: out3← SentimentAnalysisExpert(comment,out1,out2)\n31: out4← PolarizationAssessment(comment,out3)\n32: if out4.group then\n33: triplet←(out4.group,out4.score,out4.targetGroup)\n34: else\n35: triplet←(null,out4.score,out4.targetGroup)\n36: end if\n37: triplets.add(triplet)\n38: end for\n39: return triplets\n40: end procedure\n8 Zixin Liu et al.\ning Stage, which uses textual information to understand the event and identify\npotential subgroups.

After this analysis, the Social Media Veteran passes the comprehended\ninformation to the Sentiment Analysis Expert for further processing.\nLinguistic Expert The Linguistic Expert is another key agent responsible for\nthe semantic understanding of social media content. Unlike the Social Media\nVeteran, the Linguistic Expert focuses on analyzing the text from a linguistic\nA More Advanced Group Polarization Measurement Scheme 9\nperspective,examiningaspectssuchasgrammaticalstructure,rhetoricaldevices,\nword choice, and tense. The analysis results are also passed to the Sentiment\nAnalysis Expert.

The results of this sentiment analysis\nwillserveastheoutputofthesentimentanalysisstageandwillbepassedtothe\nnext stage.\nPolarization Assessment Stage The primary task of the Polarization As-\nsessment Stage is to utilize the information from the Background Mining Stage\nand the Semantic Analysis Stage to generate CSN in the form of triplets. Its\nfunctionality can be described as follows:\nInput: All information from the Background Mining Stage (including po-\ntential subgroups and event background), each text from the target topic, and\ntheir sentiment analysis results.\nOutput:Sentimentexpressedintheformoftripletsforeachcomment:(per-\nsonal stance, sentiment score, target subgroup).\nPolarization Assessor The Polarization Assessor is the core agent of the Po-\nlarization Assessment Stage. It is responsible for analyzing the author’s stance,\nsentiment score, and the target group of the sentiment for each comment, based\non the information passed from the other stages.

How-\never, as we mentioned earlier, this method is only applicable when there are\nexactly two subgroups involved in group polarization. Therefore, we extended\nthis calculation method to the multi-group domain and proposed the Commu-\nnity Opposition Index (COI).\nFirstly, we calculate the sentiment score of a subgroup towards the other\nsubgroups:\n(−e )·1 (1)\nij eij≤0\nHere, e represents the sentiment score of subgroup i towards subgroup j.\nij\n1 means that we consider friendly subgroups as not contributing to the\neij≤0\noverall group polarization.\nSubsequently, we sum the sentiment scores of subgroup i towards all other\nrelated subgroups and take into account the internal cohesion within each sub-\ngroup.Therefore, we get the polarization score of subgroup i. Here, t represents\ni\nthe internal cohesion of the subgroup i.\n(cid:88)\nt · (−e )·1 (2)\ni ij eij≤0\nj\nFinally, we weight the overall sentiment score of each subgroup according to\nits size and calculate the final polarization score.\nA More Advanced Group Polarization Measurement Scheme 11\nAlgorithm 2 Construction of Community Sentiment Network\n1: Initialize:\n2: Initialize 10x10 matrices adjMatrix, weightSum and countMatrix to zero\n3: Initialize 1x10 vector commentCount to zero\n4: incompleteTriplets←[]\n5: Process Complete Triplets:\n6: for each triplet in triplets do\n7: if triplet.group is not null then\n8: src←triplet.group\n9: tgt←triplet.targetGroup\n10: weightedScore←triplet.score×max(triplet.likes,1)\n11: adjMatrix[src][tgt]←adjMatrix[src][tgt]+weightedScore\n12: weightSum[src][tgt]←weightSum[src][tgt]+max(triplet.likes,1)\n13: countMatrix[src][tgt]←countMatrix[src][tgt]+1\n14: commentCount[src]←commentCount[src]+1\n15: else\n16: incompleteTriplets.add(triplet)\n17: end if\n18: end for\n19: Process Incomplete Triplets:\n20: for each triplet in incompleteTriplets do\n21: tgt←triplet.targetGroup\n22: probabilities←[]\n23: for i←1 to 10 do\n24: probabilities[i]←countMatrix[i][tgt]/(cid:80)10 countMatrix[j][tgt]\nj=1\n25: end for\n26: src← sample a group based on probabilities\n27: weightedScore←triplet.score×max(triplet.likes,1)\n28: adjMatrix[src][tgt]←adjMatrix[src][tgt]+weightedScore\n29: weightSum[src][tgt]←weightSum[src][tgt]+max(triplet.likes,1)\n30: countMatrix[src][tgt]←countMatrix[src][tgt]+1\n31: commentCount[src]←commentCount[src]+1\n32: end for\n33: Compute Averages:\n34: for i←1 to 10 do\n35: for j ←1 to 10 do\n36: if weightSum[i][j]>0 then\n37: adjMatrix[i][j]←adjMatrix[i][j]/weightSum[i][j]\n38: end if\n39: end for\n40: end for\n41: Output: Draw the group affect network using adjMatrix\n12 Zixin Liu et al.\n(cid:88) (n i ·t ·(cid:88) (−e )·1 ) (3)\nN i ij eij≤0\ni j\nHere N represents the total number of comments on the target topic and n\ni\nrepresents the number of comments of subgroup i within this topic.\nIt is important to emphasize that, since our metric is a relative indicator, it\ncan avoid interference in the polarization measurement results caused by differ-\nencesinthenumberofcomments.Additionally,thismetric,byfocusingonboth\nthe internal and external sentiments of subgroups, offers better interpretability.\n4 Zero-Shot Experiments\nOur experiments will be conducted on the multi-agent system. Since there is\nno established benchmark in the field of group polarization research, we have\nchosen to test the system using stance detection tasks, which share a similar\nnature. We describe the specific setup of our experiments as follows.\n4.1 Datasets\nBased on existing work in the field of stance detection [3,27,28], we will conduct\nour experiments on the following three datasets:\nSEM16[34].Thisdatasetincludessixdifferenttargetsselectedfromvarious\ndomains, namely Donald Trump (DT), Hillary Clinton (HC), Feminist Move-\nment (FM), Legalization of Abortion (LA), Atheism (A), and Climate Change\nis a Real Concern (CC).
