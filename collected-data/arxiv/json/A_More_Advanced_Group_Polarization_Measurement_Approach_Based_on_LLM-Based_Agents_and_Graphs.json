GLOBAL DIGITAL REPORT [11] indicate that platforms such as\nFacebook, YouTube, and TikTok boast billions of users worldwide. Social me-\ndia has become a key avenue for the public to express opinions and engage in\ndiscussions. Its anonymity and convenience enable users to freely express their\ntrue views, thereby shaping social media public opinion. As a result, research in\nthis field has also flourished.\nIn these studies, research from the perspective of group polarization holds\na significant position. The concept of group polarization was first introduced\nby Stoner [37], who observed that group decisions tend to be more extreme\ncompared to individual decisions [16]. In the internet era, group polarization\nis broadly defined as the divergence of public opinions or stances. Building on\narXiv:2411.12196v1  [cs.CY]  19 Nov 2024\n\n2\nZixin Liu et al.\nthis definition, researchers have conducted extensive and comprehensive studies\non various issues related to group polarization. One of the fundamental research\nproblems in the field of social media group polarization is its measurement. Early\nmeasurement methods based on statistical approaches [5,13,15,20,38] suffered\nfrom issues such as overly simplistic for the complexity of social media dynam-\nics. Current mainstream methods, such as text clustering or sentiment classifi-\ncation [4,22,35,39], struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy. While some re-\nsearchers have made significant progress by focusing on the relationships between\ndifferent viewpoints [7,17,21,26,32], these studies still fall short in understanding\nthe deeper nuances of opinion stances and their evolution.\nTo address the existing issues in measuring group polarization and improve\nefficiency, accuracy, and interpretability, we propose a new group polarization\nmeasurement approach based on LLM-based agents and graphs. This approach\ndraws inspiration from the stance detection task in natural language processing\n(NLP) and the earlier \"Sentiment Thermometer\" method. We use a Commu-\nnity Sentiment Network (CSN) represented by a graph structure to model\nthe polarization state, where LLM-based agents are employed to construct the\nnetwork. Additionally, we design polarization measurement metrics based on\nCSN. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we tested the module respon-\nsible for constructing CSN on zero-shot stance detection tasks, and the results\ndemonstrated its superiority in capturing the nuances of group polarization.\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows: (1) We propose a temporal\nCommunity Sentiment Network (CSN) to represent the polarization state over\ntime. (2) We introduce LLM-based Agents for stance detection into group polar-\nization measurement, significantly enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. (3)\nWe propose a more robust metric based on the CSN, Community Opposition\nIndex (COI).\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nOpinion Polarization Measurement\nAs research on group polarization deepens, extensive exploration has also been\nconducted on the measurement of group polarization, leading to the develop-\nment of a relatively comprehensive system of measurement approaches. Existing\nresearch [5,20] suggests that the current mainstream group polarization mea-\nsurement schemes can be primarily divided into three categories: volume-based,\nsentiment-based, and network-based. We will discuss the characteristics of these\nthree measurement schemes and their shortcomings when applied to the task of\nmeasuring group polarization on social media.\nVolume-based approaches primarily rely on statistical methods and were\nwidely applied in the early research of group polarization. Early researchers\ncollected data through surveys and experiments and used statistical analysis to\nobtain relevant polarization results. In current trend of exploring group polariza-\ntion via social media, volume-based schemes focus more on various data metrics\n\nA More Advanced Group Polarization Measurement Scheme\n3\nand employ statistical methods in research. Notable examples include Gaurav\net al. [13]’s political polarization study based on the moving average aggregate\nprobability method, Tumasjan et al. [38]’s analysis of political polarization using\nthe LIWC tool, and Hart et al. [15]’s use of multidimensional statistical analysis\nto analyze polarization during COVID-19.\nHowever, existing studies suggest that volume-based schemes have limitations\nin terms of capturing information and analyzing large datasets. They fail to\naccurately understand the opinions and sentiments conveyed in the text and\ngenerally rely on broad statistical metrics (e.g. word frequency, likes, bookmarks,\netc) to gather limited information. The lack of rapid information capture and\nin-depth understanding makes these techniques less effective for tracking and\nreal-time analysis of group polarization, and they also fall short in terms of\nprecision in measuring polarization.\nCompared to volume-based approaches, sentiment-based approaches place\ngreater emphasis on the meaning and emotions conveyed in the text. Typically,\nsentiment-based approaches are grounded in natural language processing (NLP)\nand analyze social media text from the perspectives of opinions and emotions.\nThese methods generally follow two main strategies. The first involves clustering\ntexts based on the similarity of sentiments, such as the IOM-NN method pro-\nposed by Belcastro [4] for accurately detecting emotional information in political\npolarization. The second strategy leverages deep learning for direct sentiment\nclassification, exemplified by Tyagi et al. [39]’s research on polarization driven\nby climate change, and the explorations by Ribeiro et al. [35] and Jiang et al. [22]\non the relationship between misinformation and polarization.\nUnfortunately, both strategies face notable challenges in practice. For text\nclustering, current clustering algorithms are relatively coarse and simplistic,\nmaking it difficult to distinguish between disruptive information (such as ad-\nvertisements or neutral statements) and significant content. Moreover, they do\nnot account for the specific relationships between subgroups or their contribution\nto polarization, resulting in outcomes that lack precision and interpretability. In\nsentiment classification, current methods often rely on binary classifications, fail-\ning to capture the intensity of emotions. This oversimplified method negatively\nimpacts both the interpretability and accuracy of polarization measurement.\nIt is also worth noting that in political polarization research, a method called\nthe \"Sentiment Thermometer\" has been widely adopted [7,17,18,26,41]. This ap-\nproach uses surveys to gather voters’ emotional scores toward various political\nparties, thus enhancing the precision and interpretability of the analysis. How-\never, this method is costly, limited by small sample sizes, and not well-suited for\nmeasuring polarization in the context of social media.\nNetwork-based approaches represent an approach that evaluates group polar-\nization by considering social positions and relationships among groups, focusing\non emotional direction and the stance between subgroups to better measure po-\nlarization levels. Traditional social network analysis in group polarization studies\nexplores peripheral connections around core opinions to assess subgroup posi-\ntions and emotions [8,10,12,14,33,40]. Some researchers have further developed\n\n4\nZixin Liu et al.\nthis by dynamically simulating the process of group polarization to explore its\nevolutionary pathways [32,36]. With the advancement of Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs), network-based approaches have been enhanced, as demonstrated by\nvaluable explorations from researchers such as Xiao et al. [42], Zhang et al. [46],\nand Jiang et al. [21], who utilized sentiment networks and GNNs in their studies.\nWhile these studies have achieved promising results in improving the scientific\nrigor and interpretability of group polarization research, they generally lack de-\ntailed analysis of the textual content. Moreover, social division within purely\nsocial networks does not necessarily result from group polarization, raising ques-\ntions about the accuracy of some conclusions drawn from these methods.\n2.2\nLLM-Based Agents\nWith the introduction of OpenAI’s GPT series of large language models (LLMs) [9],\nnumerous research fields have incorporated or examined GPT’s capabilities. In\nthe realm of group polarization research, some researchers have also explored\nits applications. For instance, Lu et al. [31] used agent-based simulations to\nmodel group polarization dynamics, while Zhang et al. [44] employed LLM-\nBased Agents to detect stances within polarized groups. These studies have\nyielded promising results, demonstrating the feasibility and value of applying\nlarge language models in this field.\n3\nMethod\nAs we mentioned in Section 1, to achieve an accurate measurement of group\npolarization, our proposed method consists of three parts, specifically:\n(i) A Community Sentiment Network (CSN) used to represent subgroups, the\nemotions between and within subgroups.\n(ii) A efficient multi-agent system for CSN construction.\n(iii) A group polarization metric based on the CSN, Community Opposition In-\ndex (COI).\nThe set of opinion texts will be used to identify subgroups and conduct\nsentiment analysis through the multi-agent system, forming a CSN. The current\npolarization measurement result for the time slice can then be calculated using\nthe COI.\n3.1\nCommunity Sentiment Network\nThe Community Sentiment Network (CSN, see Fig. 1) is an extension of\nthe \"Sentiment Thermometer\" method. The traditional \"Sentiment Thermome-\nter\" could only be applied to two subgroups [18]. CSN extends the \"Sentiment\nThermometer\" to a directed cyclic graph that involves emotions between multi-\nple subgroups (see Figure 1). Let G = (V, E) be a graph, where V is the vertex\n\nA More Advanced Group Polarization Measurement Scheme\n5\nset containing subgroups and E is the set of edges representing the sentimental\nrelationships between subgroups. Each edge e ∈E is defined as (u, v, s) where\nu, v ∈V and s is the sentiment score. It should be noted that nodes v and u are\nallowed to be the same node, meaning self-loops are permitted. The score s can\nbe either positive or negative, reflecting the positive or negative nature of the\nsentiment.\nUnlike traditional social networks, CSN uses sentiment rather than interac-\ntions as the basis for constructing connections. Also, CSN clearly illustrates the\nvarious subgroups with different stances within the target time period and re-\nveals the emotional states between subgroups as well as the internal cohesion of\neach subgroup. Therefore, compared to clustering results or social networks, CSN\nsignificantly highlights the contributions of different subgroups to polarization,\nproviding greater interpretability of the polarization state.\nFig. 1: An example of a CSN generated by Graphviz. This CSN was generated\nbased on comments during the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\n6\nZixin Liu et al.\n3.2\nA Multi-Agent System For CSN Construction\nThe construction of the CSN involves multiple issues, such as subgroup iden-\ntification, stance detection of opinion information, and sentiment recognition.\nHowever, existing research in the field of group polarization is insufficient to\nprovide effective solutions to these issues. Therefore, inspired by the advance-\nments in stance detection tasks [42], we designed a multi-agent system based on\nLLM-based agents (see Fig. 2).\nFig. 2: The structure of multi-agent system for CSN construction, containing\nBackround Mining Stage, Semantic Analysis Stage and Polarization Assessment\nStage.\nIn summary, our multi-agent system is composed of three stages: the Back-\nground Mining Stage, the Semantic Analysis Stage, and the Polarization Assess-\nment Stage. The Background Mining Stage consists of Subgroup Exploration\nExpert and Domain Specialist, the Semantic Analysis Stage includes Social Me-\ndia Veteran, Linguistic Expert, and Sentiment Analysis Expert. The Polariza-\ntion Assessment Stage comprises Polarization Assessor. The agents collaborate\nthrough a series of interactions to provide accurate subgroup division results and\nreliable sentiment scores (see Alg. 1). We will provide a detailed explanation of\neach stage and the functions of the respective agents in the following paragraphs.\nBackground Mining Stage For the construction of the CSN, the first issue\nwe need to address is how the multi-agent system understands the overall event\nwithin the context of the event. To solve this, we propose the Background Min-\n\nA More Advanced Group Polarization Measurement Scheme\n7\nAlgorithm 1 Triplets Construction Algorithm\n1: Input: Comments data within a specified time range\n2: Output: Set of triplets as analysis results\n3: procedure AnalyzeComments(comments)\n4:\nbg ←DomainSpecialist(comments)\n▷bg for background\n5:\nsg ←∅\n▷sg for subgroups\n6:\nuncertainComments ←[]\n7:\nSubgroupExplorationExpert(bg)\n8:\nfor each comment in comments do\n9:\ngrp ←SubgroupExplorationExpert(comment)\n10:\nif not grp then\n11:\nuncertainComments.add(comment)\n12:\nif length(uncertainComments) reaches threshold then\n13:\ngrp ←HumanExpertHelp(uncertainComments)\n14:\nsg.add(grp)\n15:\nuncertainComments ←[]\n16:\nend if\n17:\nelse\n18:\nsg.add(grp)\n19:\nend if\n20:\nend for\n21:\nInitialize Experts:\n22:\nSocialMediaVeteran(sg, bg)\n23:\nLinguisticExpert(bg)\n24:\nSentimentAnalysisExpert(sg)\n25:\nPolarizationAssessment(sg, bg)\n26:\ntriplets ←∅\n27:\nfor each comment in comments do\n28:\nout1 ←SocialMediaVeteran(comment)\n29:\nout2 ←LinguisticExpert(comment)\n30:\nout3 ←SentimentAnalysisExpert(comment, out1, out2)\n31:\nout4 ←PolarizationAssessment(comment, out3)\n32:\nif out4.group then\n33:\ntriplet ←(out4.group, out4.score, out4.targetGroup)\n34:\nelse\n35:\ntriplet ←(null, out4.score, out4.targetGroup)\n36:\nend if\n37:\ntriplets.add(triplet)\n38:\nend for\n39:\nreturn triplets\n40: end procedure\n\n8\nZixin Liu et al.\ning Stage, which uses textual information to understand the event and identify\npotential subgroups. Its functionality can be described as follows:\nInput: All the comment texts related to the target topic (sampled if neces-\nsary).\nOutput: A description of the event’s background, all potential subgroups\npresent in the topic, and detailed descriptions of each subgroup.\nDomain Specialist Domain Specialist is primarily responsible for extracting the\nevent background described in the comment texts. Their main tasks include\nexploring the core event of the topic and key stakeholders. The Domain Specialist\ndevelops a comprehensive description of the event’s timeline and related parties,\nproviding this background information to the Subgroup Exploration Expert and\nother subsequent stages of the process.\nSubgroup Exploration Expert The task of the Subgroup Exploration Expert is\nto use the background information provided by the Domain Specialist along\nwith the source texts to identify potential subgroups involved in the event and\nsummarize the possible speaking patterns of each subgroup’s members. This re-\nquires the expert to explore the organizations, stances, religions, and other social\nidentities referenced in the texts and form subgroups based on the similarity of\ntheir expressions. It is important to note that if there is a significant amount\nof unclassifiable content, the expert is permitted to consult human experts for\nclarification.\nSemantic Analysis Stage Building on the background information, Semantic\nAnalysis Stage needs to address the primary challenge of accurately interpreting\nthe emotions conveyed in the texts, especially when slang, homophones, sarcasm,\nand other nuanced expressions are present. To achieve better results on this\ncomplex task, we design the system with the specific attributes of social media\nin mind. Its functionality can be described as follows:\nInput: Comment texts under the target topic and results from Background\nMining Stage.\nOutput: Sentiment analysis result.\nSocial Media Veteran The Social Media Veteran is one of the key agents re-\nsponsible for semantic understanding of social media content. Its main role is to\nexplore the patterns and characteristics of language expression on social media\nplatforms. The agent needs to interpret the actual meanings of hashtags, internet\nslang, memes, and other unique forms of expression commonly used on social\nmedia. After this analysis, the Social Media Veteran passes the comprehended\ninformation to the Sentiment Analysis Expert for further processing.\nLinguistic Expert The Linguistic Expert is another key agent responsible for\nthe semantic understanding of social media content. Unlike the Social Media\nVeteran, the Linguistic Expert focuses on analyzing the text from a linguistic\n\nA More Advanced Group Polarization Measurement Scheme\n9\nperspective, examining aspects such as grammatical structure, rhetorical devices,\nword choice, and tense. The analysis results are also passed to the Sentiment\nAnalysis Expert. It is important to note that the Linguistic Expert’s analysis is\nnot conducted in isolation; the background information provided by the Domain\nExpert supports and informs the linguistic analysis.\nSentiment Analysis Expert The Sentiment Analysis Expert is the agent responsi-\nble for synthesizing various inputs to determine the final sentiment and its direc-\ntion. It combines the emotional language present in the text with the semantic\nanalysis results provided by other agents, such as the Social Media Veteran and\nthe Linguistic Expert, to derive the sentiment of the text. Additionally, it utilizes\nthe subgroup information provided by the subgroup exploration expert to iden-\ntify the potential target of the sentiment. The results of this sentiment analysis\nwill serve as the output of the sentiment analysis stage and will be passed to the\nnext stage.\nPolarization Assessment Stage The primary task of the Polarization As-\nsessment Stage is to utilize the information from the Background Mining Stage\nand the Semantic Analysis Stage to generate CSN in the form of triplets. Its\nfunctionality can be described as follows:\nInput: All information from the Background Mining Stage (including po-\ntential subgroups and event background), each text from the target topic, and\ntheir sentiment analysis results.\nOutput: Sentiment expressed in the form of triplets for each comment: (per-\nsonal stance, sentiment score, target subgroup).\nPolarization Assessor The Polarization Assessor is the core agent of the Po-\nlarization Assessment Stage. It is responsible for analyzing the author’s stance,\nsentiment score, and the target group of the sentiment for each comment, based\non the information passed from the other stages. The Polarization Assessor in-\ntegrates this information into triplets. With the multi-dimensional and in-depth\nanalysis provided by the other stages, the Polarization Assessor can make precise\njudgments and give credible sentiment score.\nCSN Construction To construct the final Community Sentiment Network (CSN)\nbased on the sentiment triplets from the existing comments, we designed the rele-\nvant algorithm (see Alg. 2, Table 1 explains some variables). We use an adjacency\nmatrix, adjMatrix, to represent the CSN, where adjMatrix[i][j] represents the\nsentiment score of subgroup i towards subgroup j. We first use all the triplets to\nbuild an initial network and then merge the nodes that belong to the same sub-\ngroup. During the merging process, we use the number of likes on the comments\nas a weighting factor, applying a weighted calculation to the sentiment scores\nbetween subgroups involved in the sentiment. This results in a total sentiment\nscore between the subgroups. Since not all triplets have a personal stance, we\n\n10\nZixin Liu et al.\ncomplete them by approximating the occurrence frequency of all known per-\nsonal stances as probabilities and use these probabilities to fill in the incomplete\ntriplets. These operations results in the final CSN.\nTable 1: The explanation of some variables in Alg. 2.\nVariable\nExplanation\nweightSum\ntriplets’ weight\ncountMatrix[i][j] number of triplets whose person stance is i and target subgroup is j\nincompleteTriplets variable for storing incomplete triplets\ncommentCount\nnumber of comments in every subgroup\n3.3\nCommunity Opposition Index (COI)\nWe have designed a dedicated group polarization metric for CSN to derive a com-\nparable and interpretable polarization index from its complex graph structure.\nIn previous research on sentiment-based polarization measurement, a widely ac-\ncepted viewpoint is that the stronger the internal cohesion within subgroups\nand the greater the hostility between subgroups, the higher the level of polar-\nization [18,19,26,41,43]. The \"Sentiment Thermometer\" was developed based on\nthis perspective, and its approach of calculating sentiment temperature differ-\nences has gained widespread recognition and practical use [7,17,18,26,41]. How-\never, as we mentioned earlier, this method is only applicable when there are\nexactly two subgroups involved in group polarization. Therefore, we extended\nthis calculation method to the multi-group domain and proposed the Commu-\nnity Opposition Index (COI).\nFirstly, we calculate the sentiment score of a subgroup towards the other\nsubgroups:\n(−eij) · 1eij≤0\n(1)\nHere, eij represents the sentiment score of subgroup i towards subgroup j.\n1eij≤0 means that we consider friendly subgroups as not contributing to the\noverall group polarization.\nSubsequently, we sum the sentiment scores of subgroup i towards all other\nrelated subgroups and take into account the internal cohesion within each sub-\ngroup.Therefore, we get the polarization score of subgroup i. Here, ti represents\nthe internal cohesion of the subgroup i.\nti ·\nX\nj\n(−eij) · 1eij≤0\n(2)\nFinally, we weight the overall sentiment score of each subgroup according to\nits size and calculate the final polarization score.\n\nA More Advanced Group Polarization Measurement Scheme\n11\nAlgorithm 2 Construction of Community Sentiment Network\n1: Initialize:\n2: Initialize 10x10 matrices adjMatrix, weightSum and countMatrix to zero\n3: Initialize 1x10 vector commentCount to zero\n4: incompleteTriplets ←[]\n5: Process Complete Triplets:\n6: for each triplet in triplets do\n7:\nif triplet.group is not null then\n8:\nsrc ←triplet.group\n9:\ntgt ←triplet.targetGroup\n10:\nweightedScore ←triplet.score × max(triplet.likes, 1)\n11:\nadjMatrix[src][tgt] ←adjMatrix[src][tgt] + weightedScore\n12:\nweightSum[src][tgt] ←weightSum[src][tgt] + max(triplet.likes, 1)\n13:\ncountMatrix[src][tgt] ←countMatrix[src][tgt] + 1\n14:\ncommentCount[src] ←commentCount[src] + 1\n15:\nelse\n16:\nincompleteTriplets.add(triplet)\n17:\nend if\n18: end for\n19: Process Incomplete Triplets:\n20: for each triplet in incompleteTriplets do\n21:\ntgt ←triplet.targetGroup\n22:\nprobabilities ←[]\n23:\nfor i ←1 to 10 do\n24:\nprobabilities[i] ←countMatrix[i][tgt]/ P10\nj=1 countMatrix[j][tgt]\n25:\nend for\n26:\nsrc ←sample a group based on probabilities\n27:\nweightedScore ←triplet.score × max(triplet.likes, 1)\n28:\nadjMatrix[src][tgt] ←adjMatrix[src][tgt] + weightedScore\n29:\nweightSum[src][tgt] ←weightSum[src][tgt] + max(triplet.likes, 1)\n30:\ncountMatrix[src][tgt] ←countMatrix[src][tgt] + 1\n31:\ncommentCount[src] ←commentCount[src] + 1\n32: end for\n33: Compute Averages:\n34: for i ←1 to 10 do\n35:\nfor j ←1 to 10 do\n36:\nif weightSum[i][j] > 0 then\n37:\nadjMatrix[i][j] ←adjMatrix[i][j]/weightSum[i][j]\n38:\nend if\n39:\nend for\n40: end for\n41: Output: Draw the group affect network using adjMatrix\n\n12\nZixin Liu et al.\nX\ni\n(ni\nN · ti ·\nX\nj\n(−eij) · 1eij≤0)\n(3)\nHere N represents the total number of comments on the target topic and ni\nrepresents the number of comments of subgroup i within this topic.\nIt is important to emphasize that, since our metric is a relative indicator, it\ncan avoid interference in the polarization measurement results caused by differ-\nences in the number of comments. Additionally, this metric, by focusing on both\nthe internal and external sentiments of subgroups, offers better interpretability.\n4\nZero-Shot Experiments\nOur experiments will be conducted on the multi-agent system. Since there is\nno established benchmark in the field of group polarization research, we have\nchosen to test the system using stance detection tasks, which share a similar\nnature. We describe the specific setup of our experiments as follows.\n4.1\nDatasets\nBased on existing work in the field of stance detection [3,27,28], we will conduct\nour experiments on the following three datasets:\nSEM16 [34]. This dataset includes six different targets selected from various\ndomains, namely Donald Trump (DT), Hillary Clinton (HC), Feminist Move-\nment (FM), Legalization of Abortion (LA), Atheism (A), and Climate Change\nis a Real Concern (CC). It includes three types of stances: Favor, Against, and\nNone.\nP-Stance [30]. This dataset includes six different targets selected from politi-\ncal domains, namely Donald Trump (Trump), Joe Biden (Biden), Bernie Sanders\n(Sanders). It includes three types of stances: Favor and Against.\nVAST [1]. This dataset includes large number of varying targets, and it\nincludes three types of stances: Pro, Con and Neutral.\nThe statistics of our utilized datasets are shown in Table 2. Since our model’s\nuse case is almost zero-shot, we will utilize these three datasets to conduct zero-\nshot stance detection. We will strictly adhere to the licensing requirements of\nthe respective datasets.\nTo better evaluate the model’s performance, we selected appropriate metrics\nbased on existing literature [2,25,29]. For the SEM16 and P-Stance datasets, we\nchose Favg, which represents the average of F1 scores for Favor and Against. For\nthe VAST dataset, we opted for Macro-F1 as the evaluation metric.\n4.2\nModel Adjustment\nSince the primary purpose of our designed multi-agent system is to construct\nthe CSN, we need to adjust the model for the experiments. We removed the\n\nA More Advanced Group Polarization Measurement Scheme\n13\nTable 2: Statistics of our utilized datasets.\nDataset\nTarget\nPro\nCon\nNeutral\nSEM16\nDT\n148 (20.9%)\n299 (42.3%)\n260 (36.8%)\nHC\n163 (16.6%)\n565 (57.4%)\n256 (26.0%)\nFM\n268 (28.2%)\n511 (53.8%)\n170 (17.9%)\nLA\n167 (17.9%)\n544 (58.3%)\n222 (23.8%)\nA\n124 (16.9%)\n464 (63.3%)\n145 (19.8%)\nCC\n335 (59.4%)\n26 (4.6%)\n203 (36.0%)\nP-Stance\nBiden\n3217 (44.1%) 4079 (55.9%)\n-\nSanders 3551 (56.1%) 2774 (43.9%)\n-\nTrump 3663 (46.1%) 4290 (53.9%)\n-\nVAST\n-\n6952 (37.5%) 7297 (39.3%) 4296 (23.2%)\nSubgroup Exploration Expert and eliminated the subgroup exploration process.\nInstead, we input texts with predefined target groups into the remaining five\nagents and obtained the output from the Polarization Assessor. The adjusted\nmodel’s output only includes the sentiment score and target group, making it\nsuitable for performing stance detection tasks.\nRegarding the specific details of the model configuration, we use multiple\nGPT-3.5 Turbo models provided by OpenAI to serve as agents in the Background\nMining Stage and Semantic Analysis Stage, while GPT-4 is employed as the\nPolarization Assessor. This selection was primarily based on a balance between\ncost and the desired final performance.\n4.3\nComparison Methods\nWe compare our method with various methods in zero-shot stance detection.\nThis includes adversarial learning method: TOAD [2], contrastive learning meth-\nods: PT-HCL [28], Bert-based techniques: TGANet [1] and Bert-GCN [29],\nLLM-based techniques: GPT-3.5 Turbo [44], GPT-3.5 Turbo+Chainof-thought\n(COT) [45] and COLA [25].\n4.4\nZero-Shot Stance Detection Results\nIn Table 3, we present the performance of our method on the zero-shot stance de-\ntection task, along with a comparison to other baselines. The results demonstrate\nthat our method exhibits excellent performance in this task, with a performance\nimprovement of 8.4% over the current best result on the VAST dataset. Although\nour method did not achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across all metrics,\nits ability to come close to or surpass current SOTA algorithms indicates its\nsignificant value when applied to group polarization research.\n\n14\nZixin Liu et al.\nTable 3: Comparison of our method and baselines in zero-shot stance detection\ntask, all values are percentages.

Our solution innovatively introduces a large language model-based\nmulti-agent system into the measurement of group polarization and utilizes the\nCommunity Sentiment Network (CSN) to represent the polarization state. Addi-\ntionally, we provided a metric (Community Opposition Index) for calculating po-\nlarization levels using the CSN, allowing the polarization state to be quantified.\nFinally, we tested our multi-agent system through a zero-shot stance detection\ntask, and the results demonstrated its usability and value.\nReferences\n1.
