Introduction\nErgonomics plays a crucial role in ensuring safety, health, and performance in various settings, including educa-\ntional institutions, where efforts are made to optimize work and study environments for both teachers and students\nto enhance productivity and minimize the risk of musculoskeletal discomfort [ 1 ]. Integrating ergonomic principles\ninto education can improve the quality and increase productivity. For instance, research has shown that sitting posture\nand positioning significantly influence typing and handwriting performance [ 2 ]. Designing ergonomic solutions often\n∗Corresponding author\n∗∗Authors contributed equally\nEmail addresses: anikks18@gmail.com (Anik Kumar Saha), abrar.jahin.2652@gmail.com (Md Abrar Jahin),\nrafiq123@iem.kuet.ac.bd (Md.

Mridha)\nPreprint submitted to Heliyon\nNovember 20, 2024\narXiv:2403.05589v4  [cs.HC]  18 Nov 2024\n\nrelies on tools such as anthropometry, which involves measuring the size, shape, and capabilities of the human body\nfor task performance [ 3 ,\n 4 ].\nSeveral studies have proposed methods and guidelines for designing ergonomic classroom furniture tailored to\nstudents of different ages, providing relevant anthropometric dimensions and data for such designs [ 5 ,\n 6 ]. Among the\nvarious models for ergonomic furniture design, the ’design for adjustable range’ model is widely recommended, as it\nconsiders a range of anthropometric measures of end-users, typically between the 5th and 95th percentiles of the user\npopulation [ 7 ].\nThe motivation for this study stems from the growing recognition of the importance of ergonomic design for en-\nhancing human productivity and well-being. Numerous studies have demonstrated the positive impact of ergonomi-\ncally designed furniture on comfort, health, and performance, especially in settings where individuals spend prolonged\nperiods of time seated at desks, such as offices and educational institutions. As computers and digital technology\ncontinue to permeate various aspects of academic and professional life, ensuring optimal ergonomic conditions in\ncomputer laboratories has become increasingly crucial. However, while ergonomic guidelines and standards exist\nfor general office environments, tailored guidelines for computer laboratories, particularly for university students, are\nlacking.\nThis study addresses this gap by proposing anthropometric-based furniture dimensions specifically designed for\nuniversity students. This research aims to optimize furniture design in university computer labs to better accommodate\nstudents’ physical characteristics.\nThe main goal of this study was to assess the current status of computer laboratories in Bangladesh by gathering\nanthropometric data from students. We sought to identify potential mismatches between anthropometric measure-\nments and computer lab furniture dimensions to establish better design parameters for university students. By consid-\nering relevant anthropometric measurements of students sitting, our aim was to minimize potential mismatches and\nprolonged health issues. Additionally, this study aims to assess and compare the potential mismatch between two\nexisting computer tables and chair sets. We proposed standardized design criteria and dimensions based on anthro-\npometry and student safety guidelines.\nImplementing anthropometric-based furniture dimensions tailored for university students can significantly en-\nhance the ergonomic design of computer laboratories. By reducing potential mismatches between students’ physical\nmeasurements and furniture dimensions, this research contributes to the creation of safer, more comfortable, and more\nproductive learning environments. These optimized furniture dimensions have the potential to minimize the risk of\nmusculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and discomfort among students, thereby promoting their overall well-being and\nacademic performance. Furthermore, by providing tailored guidelines for computer laboratory furniture design, this\nstudy offers practical insights that can inform future research and guide the development of ergonomic standards in\neducational institutions.\n2. Literature Review\nHitka and Gejdoˇs analyzed a sample of Slovak university students from 2000-2006 and 2018-2023 for 25 anthro-\npometric measures relevant to workspace design. They showed a decrease in Slovakia’s adult population trend, with\nsignificant changes observed only in body weight among young adults [ 8 ]. Kang et al. investigated changes in body\ndimensions over time in Western (US) and Eastern (Korean) populations, focusing on the dimensions pertinent to\nautomobile driver seat design. Data from the ANSUR and Size Korea datasets at two time points showed a consistent\nincrease in body dimensions for both sexes in both populations [ 9 ]. Rababah and Etier showed that anthropometric\nmeasures in children are vital for designing child-centric furniture, tools, and toys. They analyzed a dataset of 354\nchildren from Jordan across six age groups (six months to nine years), including 23 anthropometric measurements\n[ 10 ]. Goleij et al. (2024) reviewed anthropometric changes worldwide over 30 years and analyzed 132 articles. They\nfound significant increases in various body dimensions, emphasizing the need for regular updates and adaptations in\nwork environments and equipment based on new anthropometric data [ 11 ]. Hitka et al. (2022) determined the ideal\ndimensions of wooden chairs for the adult bariatric subpopulation of Slovakia. By tracking long-term anthropometric\nchanges, they were able to identify the body height of 95% of adult males [ 12 ].\nLaeser et al. recognized the necessity for furniture designed for 6th and 8th-grade children. In their study, students\nfrom these grades performed keyboarding and mousing tasks at two computer workstations. One workstation was a\n2\n\nconventional desktop setup, and the other featured an adjustable keyboard. The study found that the overall posture\nscores of the students improved when using the adjustable workstation, as indicated by the Rapid Upper Limb Assess-\nment [ 13 ]. Thariq found that the current side-mounted desktop chair designs are not suited to fulfilling the postural\nand comfort requirements of university students in their learning environment. They conducted an anthropometric\nsurvey of university students in Sri Lanka. The survey aimed to create fixed-type and side-mounted desktop chairs\nand evaluate their comfort levels based on the design dimensions [ 14 ]. Taifa and Desai recognized the issue of poorly\ndesigned furniture for engineering students in India. The authors employed a health survey, specifically an ergonomic\nassessment, to gather and analyze the data in their study. Based on their findings, the authors proposed the design of\nadjustable classroom furniture as a solution to reduce MSDs [ 15 ]. Hoque et al. found that classroom furniture does\nnot consider ergonomics. The authors conducted an anthropometric survey of 500 Bangladeshi university students,\nfollowed by a mismatch analysis. Based on their findings, the authors recommended the use of ergonomically fit\nfurniture [ 16 ]. Joshi et al. addressed the significant rise in the design of computer workstations and the associated\nhealth and safety issues for users. They conducted postural assessment using the participative ergonomic technique of\nRapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA). The study revealed that most computer users lacked adequate information\nregarding the positioning of computer workstations, and a substantial number of computer operators reported issues\nwith their upper extremities [ 17 ].\nKahya investigated the congruence between school furniture dimensions and students’ anthropometric measure-\nments. They assessed nine anthropometric dimensions of 225 students from nine departments. The results indicated\na significant mismatch, with a seat height discrepancy of 44.45% discrepancy, seat depth of 100% discrepancy, and\ndesk height of 21.28% discrepancy. This study lays the groundwork for further exploration of classroom ergonomics\nin university settings [ 18 ]. Abd Rahman et al. developed an anthropometric database tailored to Malaysian opera-\ntors, focusing on sitting and standing dimensions. The database was constructed from the measurements of 146 male\nand 168 female participants aged 18-45 years. Thirty-six anthropometric dimensions were chosen to compare their\navailability across the four countries. This knowledge of population variations is crucial for designing workstations\nand facilities that accommodate the needs of the industrial environment [ 19 ]. Langov´a et al. presented a method for\ndesigning chair dimensions based solely on the height range of intended users using seven equations describing the\nrelationship between key design dimensions and human height or height range [ 20 ]. Sydor and Hitka linked chair\ndimensions to anthropometric measurements, simplifying access to data by establishing average body proportions for\nadults. Through seven equations, they related chair design dimensions to human height, thereby facilitating design\nconsiderations [ 21 ].\nParvez et al. identified that poorly fitting furniture could contribute to various MSDs and discomfort. To delve\ninto this issue, they surveyed ten primary schools in Bangladesh, revealing a notable disparity between furniture di-\nmensions and student body measurements. Moreover, this study proposes furniture dimensions that could notably\ndecrease the mismatch percentage among students from 90% to 10% [  22 ]. Shohel Parvez et al. acknowledged that in-\nadequately designed furniture could potentially exacerbate MSDs. They conducted a survey of 400 university students\n(250 males and 150 females) who volunteered for the study. The Standard Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was\nused to evaluate MSDs. The authors recommended that modifying the design of academic furniture could help allevi-\nate or prevent MSD [ 23 ]. Moradi et al. conducted an ergonomic risk assessment of auto mechanics. This study found\nthat back and waist circumference had the highest prevalence of work-related MSDs [ 24 ]. Kibria and Rafiquzzaman\ndeveloped a self-reported Nordic ergonomic assessment questionnaire to identify discrepancies between furniture di-\nmensions and anthropometric measurements. The proposed ergonomically designed computer workstation, informed\nby anthropometric measurements and guidelines, can potentially alleviate MSDs among university teachers. This\nstudy could significantly influence ergonomic furniture design in universities and other organizations by addressing\ncomputer-related ergonomic challenges [ 25 ].\nAs computer use grows, the risks of physical strains and eye issues increase. To combat this, various international\nstandards like the International Organization for Standardization [ 26 ] and guidelines from organizations such as the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration [ 27 ] offer recommendations for ergonomic workstation design. These\nfocus on factors such as the chair and desk setup, monitor positioning, and lighting to reduce strain and promote better\nhealth during computer use. The International Organization for Standardization standard specifies basic dimensions\nfor furniture used in office work, including tables and chairs, to promote user comfort and safety [ 28 ]. Additionally,\nThe European Committee for Standardization (2020) provided guidelines for the ergonomic design of workstations,\nincluding layout and postural requirements for tasks involving visual display terminals (VDTs). This standard offers\n3\n\nvaluable insights into the workstation layout and postural requirements, which are crucial considerations in computer\nlaboratory furniture design [ 26 ]. Additionally, the European Committee for Standardization specifies the functional\ndimensions of the chairs and tables used in educational institutions. This European standard outlines ergonomic fur-\nniture requirements to promote students’ health and well-being [ 29 ]. European Committee for Standardization (2012)\nprovides additional safety and ergonomic requirements for educational furniture, complementing [ 30 ,\n 31 ]. Similarly,\nthe European Committee for Standardization (2000) sets safety and ergonomic requirements for office chairs, ensuring\nuser comfort and reducing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders [ 32 ]. Incorporating the recommendations outlined in\nthese standards ensures that computer laboratory furniture is ergonomically optimized for university students, mini-\nmizing the risk of MSDs and promoting student comfort and productivity.\nCurrent literature on ergonomics and its impact on user health and performance has identified several research gaps\nthat warrant further investigation. First, comprehensive research on interdisciplinary education in design and its impact\non student learning outcomes is lacking. Second, few studies have been conducted on the impact of ergonomic furni-\nture design on children’s posture and health. Third, there is a shortage of research on university students’ ergonomic\nneeds, particularly in different countries and cultural contexts. Fourth, research on the effectiveness of ergonomic in-\nterventions in reducing the risk of MSDs and other ergonomic-related issues in educational settings is lacking. Fifth,\nlimited research has been conducted on the impact of ergonomic interventions on work satisfaction, productivity, and\noverall well-being in various educational settings. Sixth, there is a shortage of research on the long-term effects of\nergonomic interventions on students’ health, performance, and retention. Finally, studies on the cost-effectiveness of\nergonomic interventions and their potential return on investment in different occupational settings are lacking. Ad-\ndressing these research gaps will contribute to the development of more effective ergonomic interventions and overall\nwell-being in various occupational settings. However, there has been a limited emphasis on the design of furniture and\ncomputer labs for undergraduate education in universities, and there is a lack of established standards for computer\nlab furniture in Bangladeshi universities. Bangladeshi universities typically use desktops, chairs, and tables as com-\nputer laboratory furniture. The prolonged use of these improperly designed furniture pieces could exacerbate MSDs\nin young adults. Hence, ergonomically fitted furniture is crucial. Failure to address these issues promptly could result\nin undetected severe health problems among the students.\n3. Materials and Methods\n3.1. Problem Identification\nIn our study, we sought to assess the ergonomic risks that students face due to prolonged sitting at their desks\nand the potential development of Work-related MSDs (WMSDs). We developed a comprehensive self-reported ques-\ntionnaire based on the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ), which has been extensively used and validated\nin previous studies. The questionnaire was designed to gather information on the frequency and severity of muscu-\nloskeletal symptoms experienced by teachers, focusing on areas such as the neck, shoulders, back, and wrists, which\nare commonly affected by prolonged sitting and poor ergonomics. Participants were asked to report the frequency of\nmusculoskeletal symptoms they experienced, classifying them as “constantly” (most of the time during the day), “oc-\ncasionally” (two to four times a month), or “frequently” (more than four times a month). We also asked participants\nwhether they had experienced musculoskeletal pain in the past 12 months. This allowed us to assess the prevalence\nof musculoskeletal pain among teachers and identify any data patterns or trends. Approximately 78.42% of students\nreported experiencing MSD-related pain. In this group, 77.67% of the patients were male, and 81.25% were female.\nTo better understand how these factors might influence the prevalence and severity of musculoskeletal symptoms, we\ncollected demographic information, such as age, sex, and level of study. The questionnaire was administered to a\nsample of students of Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET). The collected data were analyzed\nto identify any significant associations between ergonomic factors, such as prolonged sitting and poor posture, and\nthe development of WMSDs. The reliability test for the NMQ yielded a Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.77, indicating\nan “acceptable” level of internal consistency. This value falls within the 95% confidence interval of 0.733 and 0.803,\nsuggesting that if the survey were repeated with different samples, the actual value of Cronbach’s alpha would likely\nfall within this range 95% of the time.\n4\n\n3.2. Sample Collection\nA subset of students was chosen from two departments at KUET, Khulna, Bangladesh. Equation\n 1 was used to\nestablish the necessary sample size.\nn =\nN\n1 + Ne2\n(1)\nwhere n represents the sample or population size, N denotes the total population, and e refers to the desired\nprecision level set at 5% with a 95% confidence level.\nAccording to KUET’s official database, there are currently 5,240 students enrolled, comprising 4,318 males and\n922 females. This yielded a male-to-female ratio of approximately 4.68:1. According to Equation\n 1 , a minimum of\n372 or more data points should be collected. This study gathered anthropometric data from 300 males and 80 females,\nrepresenting up to 7,000 students. The students’ ages ranged from 17 to 26 years. We collected data from June 2023\nto September 2023.\nAll participants provided written consent for the study after being briefed on its aims. The Office of the Director\nfor Research & Extension, KUET, approved the experimental procedures conducted according to the principles stated\nin the Declaration of Helsinki, bearing the authorization code KUET/DRE/2023/15(6). Participation in the survey was\nvoluntary, and participants had the right to withdraw without penalties. The confidentiality of participants’ responses\nwas strictly maintained, and all data collected were anonymized and stored securely. The dataset, available for further\nexploration, can be found in “Anthropometric Data of KUET students” ( https://dx.doi.org/10.17632/kw7fd465v7.2 )\n[ 33 ].\n3.3. Anthropometric Measurements\nThe 11 anthropometric measurements described in Figure\n 1 were obtained in this study. These dimensions were\nmeasured using definitions employed in earlier studies [ 34 ]. A chair and Harpenden Anthropometer were used to\ndetermine the seating dimensions, and sitting assistance was used to support participants in maintaining a straight\nposture with their feet flat on the floor. Before data collection, rigorous calibration of all equipment was conducted\nin accordance with the established standards to maintain the accuracy and precision of the measurements. Through-\nout the trial, the participants were instructed to maintain a straight posture on a flat-surfaced seat with their knees\npositioned at a 90◦angle. Standardized posture is crucial for the consistency and comparability of anthropometric\ndata. Participants were briefed about the study objectives, and precise postures were maintained during anthropomet-\nric measurements. All measurements were documented in millimeters (mm). Anthropometric measurements were\nperformed by trained measurers following standardized techniques as outlined by the International Society for the\nAdvancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) guidelines. All measurements were performed twice to ensure accuracy\nand reliability. The average of the two measurements was used for the data analysis.\n3.4. Furniture Dimensions\nThe dimensions used to design the furniture are shown in Figure\n 2 . This study evaluated two types of university\nfurniture sets used in KUET computer laboratories. One was a ‘table with adjustable chairs,’ and the other was a\n‘table with non-adjustable chairs,’ both commonly used in computer labs at KUET. Figure\n 2 depicts the computer lab\nfurniture design parameters, and Figure\n 3 shows the isometric view of two existing furniture sets. As such, this study\nmeasured 11 design parameters of existing computer furniture.\n3.5. Furniture Dimensions and Anthropometric Data Mismatch\nConsidering the students’ anthropometric measurements when designing and evaluating computer lab furniture\nis essential. This involves the use of relevant anthropometric estimations and ergonomic standards to determine the\nacceptable range for each furniture measurement.\nPopliteal height (PH) and seat height (SH) are typically connected. The SH should provide knee flexion to align\nthe lower legs with the body’s craniocaudal axis at a 30◦angle [ 35 ]. According to [ 36 ], PH should be higher than\nSH. This means that the shin-thigh position should be between 95◦and 120◦, and the lower leg should create an angle\nwith a vertical axis of 5◦to 30◦. While an unduly low SH can strain the ischial tuberosities, an extremely high SH can\nincrease the pressure on the bottom of the knee and nerves, thereby decreasing blood circulation [ 16 ]. The SH should\n5\n\nFigure 1: Anthropometry of the participants, (a) right-side view (on the left), (b) backside view (on the right).\n(a) Left-side view\n(b) Top view\nFigure 2: Furniture’s measurement: (a) Left-side view and (b) Top view.\nbe less than 40 mm, or 88% of the PH, to prevent excessive pressure on the buttocks [ 35 ]. The PH measurement\nconsidered shoe height by adding 30 mm. Therefore, Equation\n 2 can be used to represent the relationship between\nPH and SH:\n(PH + 30) cos(30◦) ≤S H ≤(PH + 30) cos(5◦)\n(2)\nTo allow for both furniture flexibility and essential motions, the seat width (SW) should be broad enough to\naccommodate people with the widest hip breadth (HB) [ 37 ,\n 38 ]. A proper fit is suggested by previous research, and\nthe 95th percentile of HB is a good place to start when measuring SW [ 37 ,\n 39 ,\n 40 ,\n 38 ]. The SW should be wider\nthan the HB. Previous research has suggested that the optimal SW should be within the range of 10% to 30% of HB\n[ 41 ,\n 42 ]. Consequently, the link between the HB and SW can be established using Equation\n 3 :\n(1.10 × HB) ≤S W ≤(1.30 × HB)\n(3)\nThere is a strong relationship between seat depth (SD) and buttock popliteal length (BPL), with the BPL frequently\nserving as a guide for SD development and evaluation. The fifth percentile of the BPL should be used as the basis for\n6\n\n(a) Table with adjustable chair\n(b) Table with non-adjustable chair\nFigure 3: Two types of furniture set, (a) Table with adjustable chair, (b) Table with non-adjustable chair.\nthe seat depth, according to several studies [ 38 ,\n 40 ,\n 43 ]. This guarantees that the seat backrest can support the lumbar\nspine without compressing the popliteal surface. The seat may not support the thigh when the SD is much shorter than\nthe BPL [ 44 ]. However, the user might be unable to use the backrest to support their lumbar spine if the SD is larger\nthan the BPL [ 45 ]. Accordingly, when the SD is either 95% of BPL or less, there is a mismatch between the SD and\nBPL [ 46 ,\n 47 ,\n 41 ]. Equation\n 4 can be used to express the connection between BPL and SD:\n(0.80 × BPL) ≤S D ≤(0.95 × BPL)\n(4)\nAccording to several studies, sitting elbow height (SEH) is a critical factor in Seat to Table Height (STH) determi-\nnation [ 48 ,\n 45 ,\n 35 ]. Developing an appropriate Table Height (TH) requires careful consideration of shoulder biome-\nchanics, including shoulder flexion angles between 0◦and 25◦and abduction angles between 0◦and 20◦[ 49 ,\n 47 ,\n 42 ].\nFurthermore, keeping the arms on the desk significantly reduces strain on the spine. Consequently, according to ref\n[ 50 ][50 Pheasant, 51 Poulakakis], the STH should be 3-5 cm higher than the SEH. A synchronized measure was\ncreated to verify that the SEH is the most important TH parameter and that the TH height should not increase above\n50 mm above the SEH. Equation\n 5 expresses the link between TH and SEH:\nS EH ≤TH ≤(S EH + 50)\n(5)\nThe flexibility of the arms and upper trunk depends on the appropriate backrest height (BH). It is recommended\nthat the BH value should not be higher than that of the scapula [ 37 ]. Therefore, an ideal BH is between 60% and 80%\nof sitting shoulder height (SSH) [  49 ,\n 41 ,\n 51 ]. BH dimensions should also be less than or equal to the top margin of\nthe scapula. This creates a match criterion, and Equation\n 6 shows how BH and SSH relate to each other:\n(0.60 × S S H) ≤BH ≤(0.80 × S S H)\n(6)\nThe seat-to-table clearance (STC) should be sufficiently large to provide adequate space for leg movement and for\nthe user to move the chair below the table [ 52 ,\n 35 ]. If the STC is greater than the thigh thickness (TT), it is considered\na standard dimension [ 36 ]. However, the ideal dimension of STC should be 20 mm higher than the knee height [  42 ].\nTherefore, a match criterion was developed, and the relationship between SDC and TT is shown in Equation\n 7 :\n(TT + 20) < S TC\n(7)\nThe user should have support for simple access to the seat, leg mobility, and getting off the seat from under the\nhood (UTH). In addition, the design must incorporate SH, TT, and an additional 20 mm of space to allow for a shift\n7\n\nin leg posture and the lowest standard dimension of UTH [ 53 ]. However, according to [ 42 ], the highest dimension of\nUTH cannot be greater than the difference between the maximum dimension of TH and the table thickness, which is\n30mm. Consequently, the link between UTH, PH, and TT yields a match equation, as shown in Equation\n 8 :\n(S H + TT + 30) ≤UTH ≤(S EH + [(PH + 30) cos(5◦)]\n+ 0.1483AL −30)\n(8)\nHip breadth (HB) is a key metric in the backrest width (BW) design process [ 14 ]. Taifa and Desai recently\nsuggested that HB is a pertinent anthropometric measurement for BW design [ 15 ]. Consequently, an equation was\ncreated, and Equation\n 9 illustrates the relationship between HB and BW:\nBW ≥HB\n(9)\nThe table length (TL) is crucial for providing sufficient room for shifting lower body postures or movements.\nPrevious research has suggested that TL should be higher than buttock knee length (BKL) [ 53 ]. Thus, Equation\n 10 \ndefines the TL minimal limit.\nTL ≥BKL\n(10)\nThe table depth (TD) and sitting elbow breath (SEB) anthropometric measurements were connected. The partial\nwidths of the arm length (AL) and SEB should be included in the lower bound of the table depth (TD) [ 53 ]. Sufficient\nroom is needed for a table so that one can enter and leave the seat. TD thus permits elbow abduction at 20◦with a 20\nmm margin [ 46 ,\n 49 ,\n 47 ,\n 42 ]. Equation\n 11 considers these factors as follows:\n(0.5S EB + 0.342AL + 20) ≤TD ≤EFL\n(11)\nAnother important anthropometric criterion for evaluating the upper edge of the backrest (UEB) is the sub-scapular\nheight (SCH) [ 48 ]. Numerous studies have indicated that the scapula and arm are immobile if the SCH is smaller than\nthe UEB [ 44 ,\n 52 ,\n 42 ]. Equation\n 12 , therefore, depicts the link between SCH and UEB.\nUEB ≤SCH\n(12)\n3.6. Level of Compatibility\nSome equations have single-directional limitations, while others have dual constraints to assess how well partici-\npants’ anthropometric measurements match the furniture dimensions. Match and mismatch categories were designed\nto evaluate compatibility in single-directional connections. Three categories were established for dual-directional re-\nlationships: (a) match (where the anthropometric measurement falls between the limits), (b) low mismatch (where the\nanthropometric measurement falls below the maximum limit of the relationship), and (c) high mismatch (where the\nminimum limit of the relationship exceeds the anthropometric measurement).\n3.7. Software and Statistical Tools\nIBM SPSS Statistics 26 and Microsoft Excel 2021 were used for statistical analysis. For the graphical 3D pro-\ntotype design, we used the Autodesk Fusion 360. For visualizations related to anthropometric data distribution and\ncorrelation analysis, Python 3.10.\n4. Results\n4.1. Analysis of Anthropometric Measurements\nEleven anthropometric measures were used to compute the descriptive statistics. The following values were es-\ntimated to create a standard database (Table\n A1 ): minimum (min), maximum (max), mean, standard deviation, and\nvarious percentile values (5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles). Anthropometric measurements of the male and female\nparticipants in this study were computed independently.\n8\n\n4.2. Assessment of Intra- and Inter-Class Reliability\nIntra-class reliability was assessed by comparing the measurements taken by the same measurer on two separate\noccasions, whereas inter-class reliability was assessed by comparing measurements taken by different measures. Intra-\nand inter-class reliability for the anthropometric measurements was assessed using a two-way mixed effects model,\nwhere people’s effects were considered random, and the measure effects were fixed. The assessment of intra- and\ninter-class reliability is crucial for ensuring the precision and consistency of our data.\nIn this study, we obtained high intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC1) for both single measures (ICC1 = 0.973,\n95% CI: 0.966 - 0.979) and average measures (ICC1 = 0.986, 95% CI: 0.983 - 0.989). These findings indicate a\nhigh level of agreement and consistency between the repeated measurements. The inter-class reliability (ICC2) was\nassessed by comparing the measurements taken by different researchers. Similarly, we found high ICC2 values for\nboth single measures (ICC2 = 0.944, 95% CI: 0.931-0.956) and average measures (ICC2 = 0.971, 95% CI: 0.964 -\n0.977). These results indicate a high level of agreement and consistency between measurements taken by different\nresearchers.\n4.3.

Mismatch Analysis\nTo evaluate the degree of mismatch between the current library furniture and body measurements, equations\n 2 \nthrough\n 12 were applied. To find a mismatch, the writers examined into 11 aspects of computer furniture. Individual\nmatches or mismatches were identified by comparing the dimensions of the furnishings with the body measurements\nof each participant. Finally, a percentage representing the measured match or mismatch for the sample population was\npresented.\n4.5. Statistical Test\nOne-way ANOVA was used to determine whether there were any statistically significant differences between the\nmeans of three or more independent groups. In this study, the furniture dimensions were tested against anthropometric\ndimensions to determine any significant differences. The level of significance (α) was set at 5%, meaning that the\nresult was considered statistically significant if the p-value was ≤5%. The result was not statistically significant if\nthe p-value was > 5%. The F-value measures the variance between groups compared with the variance within groups.\nThe p-value is the probability of observing a result as extreme as obtained, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.\nIf the p-value was less than the α value (5% in this case), the null hypothesis was rejected, and it was concluded that\nthere was a statistically significant difference between the groups. If the p-value was greater than the α value, the null\n9\n\nTable 2: Summary of the level of mismatch and match percentages of existing furniture dimensions of 1st type of furniture (non-adjustable chair\nand non-adjustable table)\nDimensions and anthropometry\nGender\nMatch (%)\nLower mismatch (%)\nUpper mismatch (%)\nTotal mismatch (%)\nSH against PH\nMale\n86.67\n13.33\n0\n13.33\nFemale\n12.5\n87.5\n0\n87.5\nSW against HB\nMale\n78.67\n0\n21.33\n21.33\nFemale\n18.75\n0\n81.25\n81.25\nSD against BPL\nMale\n92\n8\n0\n8\nFemale\n86.25\n13.75\n0\n13.75\nBH against SSH\nMale\n39\n0\n61\n61\nFemale\n93.75\n0\n6.25\n6.25\nBW against HB\nMale\n70.33\n-\n-\n29.67\nFemale\n10\n-\n-\n90\nUEB against SCH\nMale\n100\n-\n-\n0\nFemale\n100\n-\n-\n0\nSTH against SEH\nMale\n66.33\n0.33\n33.33\n33.67\nFemale\n72.5\n1.25\n26.25\n27.5\nSTC against TT\nMale\n0\n-\n-\n100\nFemale\n0\n-\n-\n100\nUTH against TT, SEH, PH and AL\nMale\n0\n0\n100\n100\nFemale\n0\n0\n100\n100\nTL against BKL\nMale\n0\n-\n-\n100\nFemale\n2.5\n-\n-\n97.5\nTD against SEB, AL and EFL\nMale\n0\n100\n0\n100\nFemale\n0\n100\n0\n100\nTable 3: Summary of the level of mismatch and match percentages of existing furniture dimensions of 2nd type of furniture (adjustable chair and\nnon-adjustable table)\nDimensions and anthropometry\nGender\nMatch (%)\nLower mismatch (%)\nUpper mismatch (%)\nTotal mismatch (%)\nSH against PH\nMale\n100\n0\n0\n0\nFemale\n82.5\n17.5\n0\n17.5\nSW against HB\nMale\n43\n57\n0\n57\nFemale\n96.25\n3.75\n0\n3.75\nSD against BPL\nMale\n49.67\n50.33\n0\n50.33\nFemale\n38.75\n61.25\n0\n61.25\nBH against SSH\nMale\n39\n0\n61\n61\nFemale\n93.75\n0\n6.25\n6.25\nBW against HB\nMale\n100\n-\n-\n0\nFemale\n100\n-\n-\n0\nUEB against SCH\nMale\n100\n-\n-\n0\nFemale\n100\n-\n-\n0\nSTH against SEH\nMale\n100\n0\n0\n0\nFemale\n100\n0\n0\n0\nSTC against TT\nMale\n99.33\n-\n-\n0.67\nFemale\n100\n-\n-\n0\nUTH against TT, SEH, PH and AL\nMale\n92\n0\n8\n8\nFemale\n97.5\n0\n2.5\n2.5\nTL against BKL\nMale\n0\n-\n-\n100\nFemale\n0\n-\n-\n100\nTD against SEB, AL and EFL\nMale\n0\n100\n0\n100\nFemale\n0\n100\n0\n100\nhypothesis was not rejected, and it was concluded that there was no statistically significant difference between the\ngroups.\nThe results showed that SH, SW, BH, UEB, STH, STC, and TL of furniture dimensions were rejected for the\ntype-1 furniture set, meaning there were statistically significant differences between the groups. In contrast, SD and\nSTH were accepted, indicating that there were no statistically significant differences between the groups (Table\n A2 ).\n10\n\nFor the adjustable chair non-adjustable table, we considered both the highest and lowest limits of SH, STH, and STC.\nIf the highest or lowest limit is accepted for males and females, we consider the parameter accepted. Only the SH, SD,\nand STH dimensions were accepted according to the ANOVA test for adjustable chairs with non-adjustable tables.\nThe remaining dimensions, SW, BH, BW, UEB, STC, and TL, were rejected (Table\n A3 ).\n• H0 (null hypothesis): There is no effect or difference between anthropometric measurements and existing fur-\nniture dimensions.\n• H1 (alternative hypothesis): There is an effect or difference between anthropometric measurements and existing\nfurniture dimensions.\n4.6. Proposed Dimensions of Furniture\nTable\n 4 presents the proposed dimensions for the two types of furniture sets designed for university computer\nlaboratories, along with a comparison with relevant International Standards (ISO/EN) for ergonomic furniture design.\nThe dimensions include SH, SW, SD, BH, BW, UEB, STH, STC, and UTH. The type-1 and type-2 furniture sets have\nslightly different proposed dimensions, particularly for SH, STH, and STC. The table also indicates each dimension’s\ncorresponding International Standards (ISO/EN), providing a reference for optimal ergonomic design in university\ncomputer laboratories. The SH is suggested to be between 400 mm and 450 mm for adjustable chairs( Figure\n 4a ).\nThe recommended SH is 430 mm for non-adjustable chairs, as shown in Figure\n 4b . The proposed SW is 425 mm, SD\nis 385 mm, BH is suggested to be 350 mm, BW is 390 mm, UEB is proposed to be 465 mm, and UTH is 645 mm.\n(a) Adjustable chair\n(b) Non-adjustable chair\nFigure 4: Proposed dimensions for both types of chairs (in mm): (a) adjustable chair, (b) non-adjustable chair.\nTable 4: Proposed dimensions of furniture sets and comparison with International Standards\nDimensions\nType-1 Proposed\nDimensions (mm)\nType-2 Proposed\nDimensions (mm)\nProposed dimensions according to\nInternational Standards (mm)\nSH\n430\n400 - 450\n410 - 490 (ISO 5970:1979)\nSW\n425\n425\n440 - 480 (EN 1729-1:2020)\nSD\n385\n385\n390 - 450 (EN 1729-2:2012)\nBH\n350\n350\n340 - 400 (EN 1729-2:2012)\nBW\n390\n390\n370 - 430 (ISO 5970:1979)\nUEB\n465\n465\n450 - 530 (EN 1335-1:2000)\nSTH\n260\n235 - 310\n260 - 340 (EN 1729-1:2016-02)\nSTC\n200\n95.25 - 200\n95 - 225 (EN 1729-1:2016-02)\nUTH\n645\n645\n625 - 705 (ISO 5970:1979)\nFor non-adjustable chairs and tables, Table\n 5 presents the mismatch percentages of the proposed furniture mea-\nsurements. The SH against PH showed 5% and 12.5% for males and females, respectively. The SW against HB\n11\n\nshowed zero mismatch for males and only 1.25 lower mismatch for females. The SD against BPL showed 7.33% high\nmismatch and 0.33 % low mismatch for males, whereas 0% high mismatch and 1.25% low mismatch for females. It is\nnecessary to reduce the high mismatch for females as much as possible when designing a chair’s SD. BH, BW, UEB,\nand STC showed a 100% match for both males and females.\nCompared with the previous mismatch percentages in university furniture, the proposed dimensions exhibited re-\nduced mismatches for both males and females. The suggested measurements were more compatible than the previous\ndimensions, leading to improved comfort levels and reduced risks of MSDs for users.\nTable 5: Proposed furniture mismatch analysis for type 1 (non-adjustable chair and table)\nDimensions and anthropometry\nGender\nMatch (%)\nLow mismatch (%)\nHigh mismatch (%)\nTotal mismatch (%)\nSH against PH\nMale\n95\n0\n5\n5\nFemale\n87.5\n12.5\n0\n12.5\nSW against HB\nMale\n100\n0\n0\n0\nFemale\n98.75\n1.25\n0\n1.25\nSD against BPL\nMale\n92.33\n0.33\n7.33\n7.67\nFemale\n98.75\n1.25\n0\n1.25\nBH against SSH\nMale\n100\n0\n0\n0\nFemale\n100\n0\n0\n0\nBW against HB\nMale\n100\n-\n-\n0\nFemale\n100\n-\n-\n0\nUEB against SCH\nMale\n100\n-\n-\n0\nFemale\n100\n-\n-\n0\nSTH against SEH\nMale\n87.5\n8.75\n3.75\n12.5\nFemale\n87.5\n8.75\n3.75\n12.5\nSTC against TT\nMale\n100\n-\n-\n0\nFemale\n100\n-\n-\n0\nUTH against TT, SEH, PH and AL\nMale\n100\n0\n0\n0\nFemale\n98.75\n0\n1.25\n1.25\nTable\n 6 presents the mismatch percentages of the proposed furniture measurements for the adjustable chairs and\ntables.

Discussion\nThe normal bell-shaped curves observed in Figures\n B.1a and\n B.1b indicate the reliability and consistency of the\ncollected 11 anthropometric data collected. In statistics, a normal distribution is often considered a hallmark of\nreliable data, as it suggests that the measurements are evenly distributed around the mean, with fewer extreme values\nand more values clustered around the center. The presence of these curves in the data for both sexes indicated that the\nmeasurements were accurate and consistent without significant outliers or inconsistencies. This reliability is crucial in\nergonomic research, as it ensures that the collected data accurately represent the population and can be used to make\ninformed decisions about furniture design and ergonomics. Additionally, the normal distributions in both male and\nfemale datasets suggest that the collected measurements represent the general population rather than being skewed or\nbiased toward one gender. This further enhances the reliability and validity of the dataset and supports its applicability\nto various settings and industries.\nThe high intra- and inter-class reliabilities of our study indicate that our anthropometric measurements are highly\nreliable and consistent. These findings enhance the validity and reliability of our data and provide confidence in the\naccuracy of our measurements.\nIn Table\n 2 , for the first type of furniture, the mismatch level is notably higher for male body measurements than for\nfemales in parameters, such as SH was 74.17%, SW was 59.92%, BW was 60.33%, and SD was 5.75% higher whereas\nBH was 54.75%, and STH was 6.17% lower. Only one parameter, UEB, was found to be a 100% match for both sexes.\nThe results were particularly poor for table-related parameters, indicating that furniture was poorly fitted for users in\nthese dimensions. The results for the second type of furniture in Table\n 3 show significantly lower mismatch levels than\nthose for the first type of furniture for SH, SW, BW, STC, and UTH. BW, UEB, and STH showed zero mismatches\nfor this furniture set, and no improvements were required. However, the mismatch percentage is still sufficiently\nlarge enough for the remaining eight parameters, which still require improvements. However, the outcomes for the\ntable-related parameters remain subpar, indicating that furniture is still not well-suited for users in these dimensions.\nAfter the statistical test, the decisions were more understandable, and 11 furniture dimensions were proposed\nbased on 11 anthropometric data collected. The proposed dimensions for UTH showed a 100% match for both\nfurniture sets. The SH was proposed based on the 5th percentile of the female popliteal height with 30 mm shoe\nclearance. The proposed SW is 425 mm, based on the 95th percentile of HB in females. The recommended SD is 385\nmm, as determined by the 5th percentile of female BPL. BH is suggested to be 350 mm, considering the 5th percentile\nof female SSH. The recommended BW is 390 mm, based on the 95th percentile of male SEB. The UEB is proposed\nto be 465 mm, considering the minimum subscapular height of the female participants. The suggested UTH is 645\nmm, considering the 5th percentile of male SEH.\nDesigning a non-adjustable chair with a non-adjustable table set with a 100% match for both males and females\nwas impossible. Therefore, the dimensions were maintained to balance a reduced mismatch percentage for both males\nand females for the STH and UTH dimensions. For adjustable chairs with tables, it was possible to match the 100%\nfurniture dimensions for males and females. SH and STH showed better results for males and females because of\nthe chair’s height adjustability. SW, SD, and UTH showed results similar to those of non-adjustable chairs with table\nfurniture sets. Although adjustable chairs showed improved results in some scenarios, we considered both types of\nfurniture to be financially feasible and avoided design complexity.\nThe proposed dimensions for both types of furniture followed international standards except for SD and SW. The\nSD and SW are slightly less than those of the European Committee for Standardization (2016) [ 30 ], but these values\nare very close to the standard values. The reason behind this is that the proposed dimensions are based on our collected\nsamples that contained more male data and fewer female data. The HB is generally lower in males than in females.\nVDT should be placed according to recent studies; computer monitor placement should be based on the needs\nof a particular user and should be performed within a modest height range below eye level with a head tilt that is\nphysiologically beneficial [ 54 ]. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (2008) [ 27 ] suggests that monitors\nshould be positioned 50–100 cm away from users while maintaining a viewing angle of 15◦–20◦[ 55 ].\nUsing a keyboard and mouse is a frequent task in a computer lab, and it should be placed in the frequent or regular\nzone of the Barnes and Squires Work Envelope Model. This indicates that the keyboard and mouse should be placed\nwithin the 394 mm of table depth of 1194 mm and a table length [ 56 ].\nThe research is centered on the design of two sets of furniture identified within computer laboratories across vari-\nous departments at KUET. Although the dimensions may exhibit variability, both types of furniture share similarities\n13\n\nand are commonly employed in computer laboratories across diverse university settings. The proposed dimensions for\nthese furniture sets were tailored to accommodate the anthropometric measurements of their users without introducing\ndesign intricacies or cost escalation.\nThe practical benefits of this research are significant for educational institutions, furniture manufacturers, and\nstudents. Inconsistencies in furniture dimensions were found by comprehensively analyzing anthropometric measure-\nments and their correlation with furniture dimensions, which offers valuable insights into designing more comfortable\nand ergonomically sound furniture for university students. For educational institutions, this study suggests that in-\nvesting in furniture tailored to students’ body dimensions can contribute to a more conducive learning environment.\nComfortable and ergonomic furniture can help students maintain better posture, reduce the risk of MSDs, and im-\nprove their overall well-being and academic performance. Furniture manufacturers can benefit from this research by\nusing the proposed dimensions as a guideline for designing products that are better suited to the needs of students.\nBy incorporating these dimensions into their designs, manufacturers can create furniture that is more comfortable,\nfunctional, and attractive for their target market.\nStudents stand to gain the most from this research as they are the end users of furniture. By using furniture\ndesigned with body dimensions in mind, students can enjoy a more comfortable and ergonomic learning experience.\nThis can improve focus, concentration, and productivity and ultimately enhance academic performance.\nThis research also has managerial implications for educational institutions and stakeholders furnishing univer-\nsity spaces. Educational institutions can use these findings to inform strategic planning, prioritizing investments\nin ergonomic furniture tailored to students’ anthropometric measurements. By incorporating the research findings\ninto procurement requirements, institutions can ensure that they purchase furniture that meets students’ ergonomic\nneeds, thereby increasing their satisfaction and well-being. Based on this research, facility managers can optimize\nclassroom and computer lab layouts, ensuring that furniture accommodates students’ anthropometric measurements.\nThis promotes a more comfortable and efficient learning environment and enhances student satisfaction, well-being,\nand academic performance. Educating students about the importance of ergonomic furniture and proper posture can\nprevent MSDs and related issues and improve student satisfaction, well-being, and academic performance. Estab-\nlishing guidelines for furniture based on anthropometric criteria ensures compliance with relevant regulations and\nstandards and provides students with safe, comfortable, and ergonomic learning environments. Furthermore, invest-\ning in ergonomic furniture tailored to anthropometric measurements can enhance health, comfort, productivity, and\nsustainable practices, leading to cost savings, an improved reputation, and legal compliance.\nThe limitations of this research include the reliance on a specific population (university students); the population\nsize was 380. Although the number is statistically justified from a practical point of view, it should be increased fur-\nther in future research. The exclusion of certain anthropometric measurements and the lack of consideration of other\nfactors influencing furniture design (e.g., cultural preferences and environmental constraints) is another limitation of\nour research. Additionally, the proposed furniture dimensions may not be universally applicable and require further\nvalidation in other settings or populations. Future research could explore the implementation of the proposed dimen-\nsions in real-world classroom settings and assess their long-term impacts on student comfort and well-being using a\nlarger population size. In addition, measuring the human body repeatedly would show slightly different results every\ntime, which was neglected in our research. Further studies should investigate the effects of different furniture designs\non student performance and productivity in academic settings.\n6. Conclusions\nThis study underscores the critical importance of ergonomics in university computer laboratories, where students’\nprolonged interactions with computers necessitate optimal ergonomic conditions. By proposing anthropometric-based\nfurniture dimensions specifically tailored for university students, we aim to enhance the ergonomic design of these\nenvironments. Significant disparities were identified through meticulous analysis of 11 key anthropometric mea-\nsurements and comparison with existing furniture dimensions. Statistical validation through ANOVA reinforced the\ncredibility of our proposed dimensions, showing reduced mismatch percentages compared to existing furniture. This\nindicates higher compatibility and potential improvements in student comfort, as well as a reduction in the risk of\nMSDs. Our study also revealed significant disparities between existing furniture dimensions and students’ anthro-\npometric data, particularly in crucial areas such as SW, BH, and STC. By identifying areas for improvement and\n14\n\nproposing new dimensions aligned with students’ anthropometric measurements and international standards, our re-\nsearch offers practical insights that can inform future furniture design efforts and contribute to developing ergonomic\nstandards in educational institutions.\nImplementing these proposed dimensions can substantially improve the ergonomic design of university computer\nlaboratories, ultimately promoting student health, well-being, and academic success. Moreover, this study has sig-\nnificant practical implications for educational institutions, furniture manufacturers, and students alike. Investing in\nfurniture tailored to students’ body dimensions can create a more conducive learning environment, improving posture,\nreducing the risk of MSDs, and enhancing overall academic performance. By advocating for the adoption of ergonom-\nically designed furniture, our research seeks to prioritize student welfare and productivity in university settings.\nThe contributions of the proposed work are as follows:\n1. This study highlights the importance of considering anthropometric measurements in furniture design for edu-\ncational institutions, serving as a reference for future research and informing the design of ergonomic furniture\nin other educational settings.\n2. By identifying the mismatch between existing furniture dimensions and anthropometric measurements, this\nstudy offers practical insights for designing ergonomic furniture in university environments and for improving\ncomfort, health, and productivity among students and staff.\n3. Designing ergonomic furniture that meets the specific needs of university students and staff may lead to potential\ncost savings for educational institutions through reduced absenteeism, increased productivity, and improved\noverall well-being.\n4. We collected and analyzed anthropometric data from university students to provide valuable insights into the\nbody measurements of the target population.\n5. By comparing the mismatch between two different types of existing furniture and anthropometric data, this\nstudy offers a nuanced understanding of how different furniture designs affect users’ comfort and well-being.\nThis study also provides recommendations for optimized furniture design. The findings have significant practical\nimplications, as they can guide the development of furniture that promotes better ergonomics and reduces the risk of\nMSDs among students. Moreover, this study’s methodology and insights can be applied beyond the educational setting\nto inform furniture design for various industries and environments. This underscores the importance of considering\ncultural preferences and environmental constraints when designing furniture products. This study contributes to the\ngrowing body of ergonomics research and can potentially improve the well-being and productivity of individuals in\ndiverse settings.\nEthical Approval\nThe Office of the Director for Research & Extension reviewed and approved this study under the approval code\nKUET/DRE/2023/15(6).
