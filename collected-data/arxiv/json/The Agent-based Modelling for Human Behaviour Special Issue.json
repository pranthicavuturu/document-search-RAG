Autodesk Research, London, UK \n \n \n \n\n \n \n“We inhabit an obscure planet, in an obscure galaxy, around an obscure sun, but on \nthe other hand, modern human society represents one of the most complex things \nwe know.” – David Christian (Christian, 2014). \nIf human societies are so complex, then how can we hope to understand them? \nArtificial Life gives us one answer. The field of Artificial Life comprises a diverse set \nof introspective studies that largely ask the same questions, albeit from many \ndifferent perspectives: Why are we here? Who are we? Why do we behave as we \ndo? Starting with the origins of life provides us with fascinating answers to some of \nthese questions. However, some researchers choose to bring their studies closer to \nthe present day. We are after all, human. It has been a few billion years since our \nancestors were self-replicating molecules. Thus, more direct studies of ourselves \nand our human societies can reveal truths that may lead to practical knowledge. \nThe papers in this special issue bring together scientists who choose to perform this \nkind of research. Expanded from submissions to our annual Agent-Based Modelling \nof Human Behaviour Workshop, the studies share similar methods, all using \nvariations of agent-based-modelling (ABM) to ask their own “what if” questions. As \nguest editors, we believe such collections help bring together and enhance such \nresearch by sharing ideas. While ABM research – out of necessity – is often highly \nspecialised towards the hypotheses and phenomena under study, the research \nmethodology is shared by all (Macal, 2016). We formulate our hypothesis, develop \nour agent-based model of the relevant aspects of reality, and run experiments to \ngather evidence which may support or refute the hypothesis. An experimental model \nthat supports the hypothesis may not prove that reality follows this approach or \nagrees with this result; but it indicates that there exist a specific set of conditions \n\n \n \nwhich if found to be true elsewhere may produce the same result. Modelling tells us \nabout trends, about possible likelihoods. Our ABMs show us what will result if our \nassumptions are valid and why, whether we are examining civil violence (Quek et al., \n2009), app stores (Lim et al., 2016), the economy (Farmer and Foley, 2009), fish \nmarkets (Kirman & Vriend, 2001), language evolution (Griffiths & Kalish, 2007), or \nenergy consumption (Bentley et al., 2021). When we study human societies, ABMs \nare the tools of choice for obvious reasons: it is not ethical or safe to play “what if” \nexperiments with ourselves. The researchers in this special issue demonstrate the \nexciting potential in ABM. We can create our own safe virtual worlds and make \ndiscoveries that enlighten us about ourselves. \nIn this special issue we have a fascinating collection of studies that relate to us. For \nexample, from our first paper, “The effects of information on the formation of \nmigration routes and the dynamics of migration” by Hinsch and Bijak we may \ndiscover that as we spread across the planet both physically and culturally, the \nnature of our interactions affects ourselves in ways we may not expect. The authors \ndeveloped a spatially explicit agent-based model of human migration and showed \nthat information exchange plays a crucial role in affecting all aspects of migration: \ntoo little information results in suboptimal migration routes, increased stochasticity \nand migrants frequently not arriving at their preferred destinations, and too much \ninformation under certain conditions can lead to less predictable migration routes.  \nLikewise, from our second paper “Adapting the exploration-exploitation balance in \nheterogeneous swarms: tracking evasive targets” by Kwa et al. we might recognise \nthat like the robotic agents, we are diverse in every sense of the word, and that \ndiversity is not only to be celebrated, it is a necessity for the optimal functioning of \n\n \n \nour societies. In their work, agents with different properties and behaviours are part \nof the same collective, forming a heterogeneous swarm. The authors used a \ndecentralized search and tracking strategy with adjustable levels of exploration and \nexploitation and found that small heterogenous swarms can match and outperform \nhomogeneous swarms. They also explored using differentiated strategies to take \nadvantage of heterogenous swarms. \nOur third contribution, “Expertise, social influence and knowledge aggregation in \ndistributed information processing” by Mertzani et al. helps us understand that fields \nsuch as psychology provide insights into human behaviour and how we \ncommunicate – a topic close to our hearts as guest editors (Lim & Bentley, 2018, Lim \n& Bentley, 2019a, Lim & Bentley, 2019b, Schoots et al., 2019, Guo et al., 2020, Lim \net al., 2023). Mertzani et al. developed an algorithm for knowledge aggregation \nbased on Nowak’s Regulatory Theory of Social Influence. This theory posits that \nsocial influence consists not only of sources trying to influence targets, but also \ntargets seeking sources by whom to be influenced, and learning what processing \nrules those sources are using.  \nOur societies face constant challenges that threaten us. Sadly, humans evolved to \nbe violent, and to work together for our violent aims, as ongoing geopolitical \ninstability shows all too well. “Explaining neuro-evolution of fighting creatures through \nvirtual fMRI” by Godin-Dubois et al. investigates where these behaviours come from \nand what causes different strategies and morphologies. They developed artificial \ncreatures that engage in individual and team competitions and investigated three \ntypes of reactions: pain, vision and audition each with varying response levels but \nconsistent across all evolution types. \n\n \n \nWhen we’re not battling each other, human societies also must battle pathogens – \nmost recently in the global COVID-19 pandemic. As the virus becomes endemic and \nwe develop coping strategies, are we responding appropriately to the changing risk \nlevels? “Self-isolation and testing behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic: an \nagent-based model” by Gostoli and Silverman models this phenomenon to find out. \nIn this paper the authors developed an agent-based model which includes a \nbehavioural module determining the agents’ testing and isolation propensity. \nAccording to them, most models focus on the replication of the interactions’ \nprocesses through which the virus is passed on from infected agents to susceptible \nones; in this model, agents modify their behaviour as they adapt to the risks posed \nby the pandemic.  \nFinally, there can be no more fundamental challenge to a society than its constant \nsearch for resources to sustain itself. Our final paper “Social search and resource \nclustering as emergent stable states” by Luthra and Todd looks at the interplay \nbetween resources and consumers of those resources in a 2D simulated world. \nAgents evolve strategies to search for food and the resources resemble plants which \ngrow continuously across the two-dimensional simulated world. Resources and other \nconsumers produce distinguishable “odours” that are normally distributed around \ntheir position in the grid and agents can perceive these two types of odours and \nmake movement decisions that take them toward or away from each kind of source. \nThrough models such as these can learn why we might behave as we do as a \nspecies, and whether we can start to mitigate or redirect some of the less-than-\noptimal patterns of behaviours that our complex societies might be attracted towards. \n\n \n \nWe hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as we have, and we hope that \nyou might be inspired to ask your own “what if” questions using ABM in your work. \n \nReferences \nBentley, P.
