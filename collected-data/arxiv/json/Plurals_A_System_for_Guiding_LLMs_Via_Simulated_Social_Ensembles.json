Companies typically build a small\nnumber of foundation or “generalist” models that dominate the\nmarket [90]. However, these generalist models are used by a diverse\nbase of users—with varying preferences and values. Invariably, this\ntension sparked allegations of bias, with supposedly neutral models\naccused of favoring certain viewpoints [12, 25, 28].\nWhile a tempting solution is to aim for models that have “no\nbias” and hold a “view from nowhere” [36], truly neutral models\nare likely infeasible. Some scholars argue that all knowledge is\nsituated [36]. But with open-ended text generation, defining some\nunbiased ground truth is especially difficult. For many use cases,\nthere is no unbiased ground truth. This difficulty is compounded\nby the fact that users can ask models a large variety of questions.\nAny bias benchmark can only capture an infinitesimal slice of the\nquery space [69].\nAs a motivating example, imagine a company preparing to launch\na new work-from-home policy. The CEO seeks to determine which\naspects of the policy memo will raise concerns for employees. Or\nsuppose a housing justice group aims to identify the most effective\nmessaging for a homeless shelter proposal. LLMs can theoretically\nbe deployed for both cases. But what viewpoint should the LLM\nadopt? Different employees and residents have different perspec-\ntives. The standard approach of prompting a single model is un-\nlikely to represent diverse viewpoints. We propose an alternative\napproach: A system of LLMs engage in controlled deliberation, sim-\nulating distinct viewpoints. The CEO could create a network of\nsimulated employees to provide feedback, upweighting the voices\nof the most affected groups. The housing justice group could create\na sequence of LLMs with demographically weighted personas to\nprovide iterative feedback based on preceding concerns.\nAs an alternative to “bias-free” models, we introduce a new plu-\nralistic AI system [81], Plurals, that can accomplish these tasks.\nIt is a public-facing Python library (Figure 1 for system overview,\nFigure 2 for code snippets, see here1 for library). Plurals consists of\nAgents (optionally integrated with government datasets for nation-\nally representative personas) which deliberate within customizable\nStructures, with Moderators overseeing deliberation. Plurals is an\nend-to-end generator of customizable “simulated social ensembles”.\nWe incorporate interaction templates inspired by democratic delib-\neration theory and integration with government datasets for nation-\nally representative personas. For example, to create an Agent repre-\nsenting a male California resident, our system samples a statistically\nrepresentative citizen from American National Election Studies, and\nthen uses the citizen’s demographics and political stances as an LLM\nprompt. We draw on deliberative democracy theory, which empha-\nsizes dialogue between different views [14, 55], as a blueprint. Our\nwork builds on research in deliberation [13, 14, 27, 35, 55, 59, 80],\npluralistic sociotechnical systems [4, 33, 50, 96], and multi-agent AI\n1https://github.com/josh-ashkinaze/plurals\narXiv:2409.17213v5  [cs.CL]  19 Nov 2024\n\nAshkinaze et al.\nA\nB\nOutput\nAgent 2\nAgent 3\nAgent 1\nModerators summarize the output of multi-agent \ncommunication. \nOptionally: Initialize Agents \nfrom government datasets. \nUse templates inspired by \ndemocratic deliberation. \n1\n2\n3\nSTRUCTURES \nCustomize information-sharing structures \nin which Agents deliberate. \nMODERATORS \nSummarize multi-agent communication.\nAGENTS \nAgents are 100+ LLMs.\nPlurals System\nStructures govern what information is shared \nbetween agents.

(1) Agents complete tasks within\n(2) Structures, with communication optionally summarized by (3) Moderators. Plurals integrates with government datasets (1a)\nand templates inspired by democratic deliberation theory (1b). The building block is Agents, which are large language models\n(LLMs) that have system instructions and tasks. System instructions can be generated from user input, government datasets\n(American National Election Studies; ANES), and templates from deliberative democracy literature [14]. Agents exist within\nStructures, which define what information is shared. Combination instructions tell Agents how to combine the responses of\nother Agents when deliberating in the Structure. Users can customize an Agent’s combination instructions or use existing\ntemplates drawn from deliberation literature and beyond. Moderators aggregate responses from multi-agent deliberation.\nalignment approaches [15, 40, 47, 84, 88]. To our knowledge, Plu-\nrals is the first general-purpose toolkit for pluralistic, multi-agent\ninteractions modeled after democratic deliberation.\nWe conducted six empirical case studies of Plurals’ theoretical\nfidelity and efficacy. Across three randomized experiments, we\nfind that Plurals can simulate focus groups, leading to output that\nresonates with an online sample of the relevant audiences (above\nzero-shot and chain-of-thought generation). We view Plurals as a\ntoolkit for building towards pluralistic artificial intelligence. This\nwork has three contributions:\nTheoretical: We created a multi-agent system incorporat-\ning ideals of democratic deliberation theory. Our system\nalso introduces “interactional pluralism”, a pluralism that\nexists not only in the distribution of agent properties but\nalso in the protocols governing their interactions. Users can\ncustomize how Agents should combine information with\neach other and the information-sharing structures in which\nAgents exist.\nSystem: Plurals is a public-facing Python package with\ndocumentation and tutorials. We made these theoretical\nideals concrete, creating a usable system for pluralistic AI.\nEmpirical: We present early empirical results from our\nsystem. Two case studies demonstrate mechanistic fidelity,\nthat the system is doing what we claim it is doing. Three\ncase studies demonstrate efficacy: Simulated focus groups of\nliberals and conservatives yield output that is compelling to\nreal liberals and conservatives. One case study also shows\nhow Plurals can be used as a programmable environment\nfor creating guardrails.\nWe provide an overview of the system (subsection 1.1), review\nits grounding in prior work (section 2), explain its principles (sec-\ntion 3), and describe it in detail (section 4) with code snippets. We\nthen present six empirical case studies demonstrating theoretical\nfidelity and efficacy (section 5). We discuss limitations (e.g.: fidelity,\nsteerability; section 6) and ethical considerations (section 7). We\nconclude with future research directions and broader implications\n(section 8).\n1.1\nBrief System Overview\nPlurals allows users to create simulated social ensembles with\nAgents, Structures, and Moderators: Agents complete tasks within\nStructures, which define how information is shared between Agents.\n\nPlurals: A System for Guiding LLMs Via Simulated Social Ensembles\nModerators can summarize multi-agent communication. Each ab-\nstraction is highly customizable. Agents can use various LLMs and\nhave system instructions set manually, through persona genera-\ntion, or via American National Election Studies (ANES) integration.\nStructures vary in information-sharing, complexity, and random-\nness. For example, users can define custom networks of Agents in\na few lines of code (Figure 2). The behavior of Agents within Struc-\ntures (how they should combine information from other agents)\ncan be tuned via combination instructions. Our package comes pre-\npopulated with templates for personas, combination instructions,\nand moderators—drawing on democratic deliberation theory and\nprior work.\n2\nSystem Grounding\nPlurals is grounded in deliberation literature, sociotechnical sys-\ntems that broaden technological perspectives, and multi-agent sys-\ntems for AI alignment. The result is an end-to-end generator of\nsimulated social ensembles—groups that engage in deliberation.\nWe integrate deliberative theory into our system by incorporating\ntemplates of first- and second-generation deliberative ideals and\nusing deliberative theory to inform the structure of AI deliberation.\nWe extend previous work on broadening technological perspec-\ntives, such as Argyle et al.’s dataset-based personas [4], Gordon\net al.’s “juries” [33], and Zhang et al.’s PolicyKit [96]. Our system\nencompasses individual, group, and governance-level simulations,\nunlike previous approaches that focused on flexibility at only one of\nthese three levels. By drawing on the concept of deliberative “mini-\npublics” (groups who engage in deliberation [80]), we evolve from\naggregative methods (like juries) to a more deliberative approach.\nAdditionally, we contribute to multi-agent AI research by offering\na flexible system for creating diverse interaction structures and\nproviding reusable code and shared infrastructure for experiments.\n2.1\nDeliberation\nDeliberation is defined as “mutual communication that involves\nweighing and reflecting on preferences, values, and interests re-\ngarding matters of common concern” [14]. As Bächtiger et al. distin-\nguish [14], deliberative democracy differs from aggregative democ-\nracy. The former centers talking and the latter centers voting—\nthough they can co-occur (e.g., talking before voting [26, 41]). De-\nliberation can occur in many different forms, in many different\nways, and have many different outcome measures. In what follows,\nwe clarify the aspects of deliberation literature that inform our\nsystem.\nPractice of Deliberation. The abstractions of Plurals map to the\npractice of deliberation. Ryfe breaks deliberative practice into three\nphases [72]: (1) The organization of the encounter, (2) the delibera-\ntion within the encounter, and (3) the final product of deliberation.\nAgents are the building blocks of deliberation. As such, Agent ini-\ntialization corresponds to Phase 1. The deliberation within the\nencounter is governed by Structures and combination instructions,\ncorresponding to Phase 2. Finally, Moderators can amend the final\nproduct of deliberation, corresponding to Phase 3. Separate from\nRyfe, Morrell [59] considers three factors of deliberation that affect\noutcomes: individual dispositions, institutional structures, and fa-\ncilitators/moderators. Again, these correspond almost directly to\nour abstractions of Agents, Structures, and Moderators.\nMore generally, formal deliberation nowadays often occurs in\n“mini-publics” [80]. These are groups of citizens who come together\nto deliberate, often in an advisory role. Plurals is an end-to-end\ngenerator of simulated social ensembles. This is analogous to re-\nproducing the process of mini-public deliberation.\nDeliberative Ideals. While the ideals of deliberation are not uni-\nversally agreed upon, we adopt the dichotomy of “first-generation”\nand “second-generation” ideals articulated by Bächtiger et al. [14].\nAccording to Bächtiger et al., the first generation of deliberative\ntheorists (e.g., Habermas [35]) emphasized rationality, achieving a\nuniversal consensus, and reason-giving. The second generation of\ndeliberative theorists took a more expansive view of deliberation,\nbeyond rationality and universalism [14]. For example, second-\nwave deliberation also valued more emotional forms of commu-\nnication [61], lived experience, testimony, and storytelling [14].\nFurthermore, to second-wave theorists, the goal was not neces-\nsarily a universal consensus (since legitimate disagreement may\nstill exist after perfect deliberation [55]), but rather a clarifying of\nunderstanding [14, 27].\nWe incorporate these ideals into our system as both persona\ntemplates (how LLMs should enact personas) and combination in-\nstructions (how LLMs should combine information with others).\nTo do this, we started with the taxonomy of first-generation and\nsecond-generation principles from [14]. Two authors then engaged\nin an iterative, two-step process where we first decided whether\neach dimension was relevant to AI agents, and then how to op-\nerationalize this dimension for both generations of deliberation\nthought. Appendix Table 2 lists how we operationalized each ideal.\nSome, but not all, ideals or benefits of human deliberation may\napply to AI deliberation. Deliberative mini-publics can be useful for\nthe outcomes that they produce [14, 80, 92] or the process that pro-\nduces these outcomes. Regarding the latter, deliberation proponents\nargue deliberation has certain epistemic (outcome-independent)\nbenefits—such as increased perceived legitimacy for decisions when\nthe sequence of thought leading to them is made public [23]. It is\nthe former—outcome-oriented benefits—that is relevant to AI delib-\neration.\nTo be clear, our system is inspired by human deliberation; it is\nnot meant to substitute for it. An analogy we offer is how architects\nand engineers often draw on the natural world to create artifacts.\nFor example, Velcro was inspired by burrs sticking to the inventor’s\ndog [52]. Likewise, multi-agent LLM systems may draw inspiration\nfrom the social world—but we do not view LLM deliberation as a\nsubstitute for human deliberation. The limits of this metaphor are\ndiscussed in section 7.\n2.2\nPluralistic Sociotechnical Systems\nOther projects have sought to broaden the representation of tech-\nnology, what we term “pluralistic sociotechnical systems” for short-\nhand. These approaches usually focus exclusively on individuals [4],\ngroups [33, 50], or governance structures [96]. As an end-to-end\ngenerator of simulated social ensembles, Plurals does all three.\n\nAshkinaze et al.\nOur system extends prior work aimed at broadening the rep-\nresentation of technological systems through simulation. These\napproaches address the inherent problems of collapsing diverse\nviewpoints into a single perspective, a phenomenon we term “out-\nput collapse”. In data labeling, annotators often disagree [57, 66, 76],\nyet traditional supervised learning typically resolves these dispari-\nties by selecting the majority label. This majority-driven approach\ncan silence minority viewpoints or result in a system that behaves\nlike a “pseudo-human” [33], presenting a blurred representation\nthat diverges from individual perspectives.\nTo address output collapse, researchers developed systems that\nsimulate specific perspectives [18, 33, 37, 50]. We follow this tradi-\ntion with Plurals. The most similar system is Juries [33], which is\nan architecture and interface for person-specific models. Juries al-\nlows end-users to create panels of simulated annotators who make\nclassifications, with the option to upweight dissenting voices.\nWhile the above work primarily addresses individuals or small\ngroups, some systems enhance technology’s representativeness by\ncustomizing governance structures. For example, PolicyKit [96] al-\nlows online communities to create arbitrary governance structures\neasily, essentially letting communities embed their own values. Sim-\nilarly, Schneider et al. created the idea of “modular politics” [77],\nwhere communities construct bottom-up governance structures\nfrom distinct components.\nLarge language models (LLMs) have intensified both the prob-\nlem of output collapse and the potential solutions to combat it.\nWhile a single “ground truth” was often contested in conventional\nclassification [66, 76], open-ended text generation further com-\nplicates the notion of a single, “correct” answer. Simultaneously,\nLLMs can potentially be steered to adopt viewpoints through “per-\nsonas” [34, 42, 75]. We adopt Argyle et al’s [4] method of generating\npersonas from government datasets to use as LLM prompts. Both\nArgyle et al.’s method [4] and Gordon et al.’s Juries [33] employ\nmultiple individual characteristics to construct personas. By using\nnationally representative datasets, we create personas reflecting\ngeneral population attributes. These intersectional personas should\ntheoretically enhance diversity beyond single-attribute personas,\navoiding ecological fallacies and reducing homogenization (Case\nStudy 1).\nPlurals is an evolution and extension of the above ideas. Plu-\nrals is an evolution of prior work: What Juries is to aggregative\ndemocracy, Plurals is to deliberative democracy [86]. Unlike Juries’\nfocus on classification labels, Plurals can generate open-ended text.\nAs Gordon et al. [33] write, “jury learning does not draw on the\ndeliberative nature of juries, which has been the subject of decades\nof study in legal literature.” This deliberation is our contribution.\nPlurals also expands the core idea of Juries. In Plurals syntax (Fig-\nure 2), a Gordon et al. jury would be an ensemble where Agents\ncomplete tasks in parallel without information sharing. This is just\none way that multi-agent systems can be designed. By allowing\nusers to create diverse structures and customize Agent deliberation\nwithin these structures, we offer a more comprehensive approach to\nstudying and implementing pluralistic AI. Finally, unlike Juries [33],\nPlurals does not require a representative dataset with annotator de-\nmographics (which can be prohibitive to obtain). By allowing users\nto change governance structures, Plurals is conceptually similar to\nPolicyKit. However, Plurals differs from PolicyKit in that Plurals\nsupports the construction of Agents and Moderators (the “before”\nand “after” of Structures using Ryfe’s three-part terminology of\ndeliberation [72]). In brief, Plurals allows end-to-end generation of\nsimulated social ensembles.\n2.3\nMulti-Agent Systems for AI Alignment\nMulti-agent systems have a long history in artificial intelligence [63,\n89]. Now there is substantial interest in multi-agent LLM sys-\ntems [38, 39, 45, 54, 62, 65, 87]. Our system incorporates aspects\nof these systems such as debate [40] and the idea of role-based\ncommunication [38, 54, 65, 99].\nLike our system, several multi-agent systems are explicitly de-\nsigned with the goal of alignment [38, 40, 54, 65]. Broadly, these\nsystems typically center interactions between agents or agent roles.\nFor example, several projects have explored the role of AI align-\nment through debate( [40, 45]). Khan et al. [45] propose a system\nwhere a weaker model picks an answer after seeing stronger models\ndebate, and this process of debate leads to more truthful answers\nfor the weaker model. Other multi-agent systems center agent\nroles [38, 54, 65, 88, 99]—the idea being that agents playing distinct\nparts can aid human decision-makers [88].\nTo this body of research, we offer several contributions. More the-\noretically, our abstractions are specifically grounded in the theory\nand practice of deliberation. More practically, because our system\nhas support for Agents, Structures, and Moderators, it effectively\nenables users to customize both information-sharing (as in AI de-\nbate literature) and Agent roles (as in the AI role literature). We\nextend the debate paradigm by allowing for arbitrary information\nstructures. A back-and-forth debate is of course just one of many\npossible informational structures. Our system contributes to the\nrole-based literature by integrating with ANES, enabling users to\nquickly draw up nationally representative roles. We also design\naround deliberation—the space in between roles and information-\nsharing. For example, users can ablate the role of an Agent (i.e.:\ntheir system instructions) and the combination instructions of an\nAgent. Finally, Plurals is a fully functioning Python package and not\na one-off study. Hence, Plurals can operate as shared infrastructure.\nIt makes multi-agent systems faster to set up and more accessible\nfor researchers.\n3\nSystem Principles\n3.1\nInteractional Pluralism\nPlurals uses metaphors from human deliberation to make existing\nartificial intelligence systems more pluralistic. Thus, a core principle\nis pluralism through deliberation, or what we term “interactional\npluralism”.\nSorensen et al.’s typology of pluralistic AI systems is a use-\nful starting point [81]. They distinguish between models that (1)\npresent a spectrum of reasonable responses, (2) can be steered to\nreflect certain perspectives, and (3) are well-calibrated to a given\npopulation. The ability to craft custom personas aligns with the sec-\nond type and our use of government datasets like ANES to generate\nnationally representative personas aligns with the third type.\nPlurals extends this typology by allowing users to define the\nrules of engagement between agents: Structures shape the dynamics\nof information sharing and aggregation; Combination instructions\n\nPlurals: A System for Guiding LLMs Via Simulated Social Ensembles\nprovide an additional layer of control over how agents should incor-\nporate each other’s views. This architectural pluralism is distinct\nfrom just having a plurality of agent-level views. Interactionally plu-\nralistic AI systems enable users to control the “rules of engagement”\nthat govern how Agents with differing profiles may deliberate. Plu-\nrals enables an architectural pluralism that is distinct from the\nconceptions of pluralism in Sorensen et al. [81].\n3.2\nModularity\nThe system is modular. The same Agent can be deployed in differ-\nent Structures and Agents can also be used outside of Structures,\nincreasing the system’s versatility. Hence, the separation of Agents\nand Structures allows researchers to ablate these abstractions, facil-\nitating more precise experiments and analyses.\nApart from the practical utility, this separation between Agents\nand Structures aligns with well-established social science frame-\nworks. This conceptualization is most explicitly articulated in Struc-\nturation Theory by Anthony Giddens [32], which explores the\ninterplay between “agents” and larger “structures” agents exist\nin. Giddens aimed to transcend theories of behavior that centered\nexclusively on either individuals or societal structures. Similar dis-\ntinctions appear across disciplines: individuals and environments\nin development psychology [68], person and situation in social psy-\nchology [29], individual and field in sociology [85], and agent and\nenvironment in artificial intelligence [71]. By using Agents and\nStructures as core abstractions2, we create a modularity that res-\nonates with different disciplines.\n3.3\nGrounded in Deliberation Practice\nAs described in subsection 2.1, our abstractions (Agents, Structures,\nModerators) map to the practice of deliberation. Ryfe [72] breaks\ndeliberation into (1) The organization of the encounter, (2) the\ndeliberation within the encounter, and (3) the final product. These\nmap onto Agent initialization (Phase 1), Structures and combination\ninstructions (Phase 2), and moderation (Phase 3). By mirroring the\ncomponents of deliberation, we ground our system in it. Of course,\nthe utility of these abstractions in simulated agent space is less\nclear than with humans. However, incorporating these foundations\ncan help build realistic simulations and test whether strategies\ndeveloped in the literature can be used to improve LLM outputs.\nThe addition of Moderators provides practical benefits. Just as\nin human deliberation, it is helpful to have some summary of what\ntranspired. In many multi-agent systems, one Agent aggregates\nthe communications of others [16, 39, 87, 99]. The motivation for\nadding auto-moderators—a feature where Moderators come up with\ntheir own moderation instructions based on the task—is based on\nthe paradigm of “auto-prompting” in DSPy [45].\n2We chose the terms “Agents” and “Structures” based on AI terminology and def-\ninitional precision. We adopt conventional AI terminology, where agents refer to\nautonomous entities capable of perceiving and acting within an environment [71]. We\nopted for “structures” instead of “environment” to more accurately reflect our system.\nStructures specifically define information-sharing patterns and interaction protocols\nbetween agents, describing a more bounded space than “environment.” Unlike “envi-\nronment,” which often implies indeterminacy or randomness, “structure” connotes\nintentional arrangement. The Cambridge Dictionary defines structure as “the way in\nwhich the parts of a system or object are arranged or organized, or a system arranged\nin this way” [20]. This definition aligns with a user-tuned abstraction.\n3.4\nBalancing Autonomy and Usability\nOur system offers users substantial autonomy. First, we ensured\nthat Agents can be used outside of Structures so users are not\nwedded to Structures. Second, both Agents and Structures are highly\ncustomizable. Agents can (as some examples) be over 100 LLMs,\nintegrate with ANES, contain a different task than other Agents in\na Structure, have custom combination instructions, different model\nparameters, etc. Likewise, Structures span a range of use cases and\ninformation-sharing protocols (e.g.: debates, ensembles, graphs)\nand have tuneable parameters. Advanced users can create their\nown Structures.\nBut we tried to balance this autonomy with usability. At a high\nlevel, we tried to build abstractions that are intuitive to use. Figure 2\nshows code snippets. As discussed in subsection 3.2 and subsec-\ntion 3.3, our core abstractions (Agents, Structures, Moderators)\ncorrespond to both common terminology and the basic process of\ndeliberation. At a documentation level, our repository provides ex-\ntensive examples of how to use each component. At an instantiation\nlevel, we made the decision for most of the package to be usable\nwith very few custom arguments, leveraging defaults and templates.\nThe drawback of defaults is that “artifacts have politics” [94], and\nso this imposes certain principles on users. For example, many of\nthe templates (apart from debate) are deliberative rather than ag-\nonistic—emphasizing building on outputs rather than arguing. By\nextracting our default templates to a single human-readable file on\nGitHub, we make these defaults more legible to users—providing\nsome informational autonomy.\n4\nSystem Details and Implementation\nSee Figure 1 for a full system diagram and Figure 2 for specific\nexamples. At a high level, Plurals consists of three core abstrac-\ntions. Agents complete tasks within Structures, which define how\ninformation is shared between Agents. Multi-agent communica-\ntion can be summarized by Moderators. We now describe these\nabstractions in more detail.\n4.1\nAgents\n4.1.1\nComponent Description. Agents are large language models\nwho complete tasks. We consider an Agent to have the following\nproperties:\n• Profile: System instructions describe the Agent’s “profile”\nat a high level. These system instructions can be left blank\n(for default model behavior), set manually, or constructed\nvia various persona-based methods described below. See\nFigure 2 for examples. We provide different persona tem-\nplates as part of the package.\n• Task: This is the user prompt Agents are responding to.\nAgents can have distinct tasks or inherit tasks from the\nlarger Structure in which they exist.\n• Combination Instructions: Combination instructions de-\nfine how Agents combine information from other Agents\nto complete the task. These are special kinds of instructions\nthat are only visible when prior responses are in the Agent’s\nview. Users can rely on templates or create their own. We\nprovide, and empirically test, templates inspired by deliber-\native democracy—spanning first-wave (reason-giving) and\n\nAshkinaze et al.\nsecond-wave (perspective-valuing) deliberation ideals [14].\nOther templates include (e.g.) a “critique and revise” tem-\nplate based on Constitutional AI [8] and a template inspired\nby New York state’s juror deliberation instructions [82].\n• Knowledge: Conceptually, Agents differ in the knowledge\nthat they have. Currently, we rely on the ability to use\ndifferent models as a way to leverage distinct knowledge.\nDifferent models likely differ in training data and human re-\nfinement, leading to divergent priors [5]. Users can also use\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) libraries with our\nsystem. For example, users can retrieve relevant documents\nfor a task and add these to an Agent’s system instructions.\nWe plan on adding more native support for RAG in future\niterations of the system.\n• Model: Agents are initialized to be a particular LLM and can\noptionally include keyword arguments like temperature.\nWe use LiteLLM3 as a backend for API requests, so Plurals\nsupports over 100 LLMs.\n4.1.2\nImplementation. System instructions can be instantiated di-\nrectly by the user or by using our persona-based methods. When\nusing persona-based methods, the full system instructions are a\ncombination of a specific persona and a persona template which\ngives more instructions on how to enact that persona. See Figure 2a\nfor an example. In that example, there is a specific persona from\nANES “You are a...” and then a template from second-wave deliber-\nation that formats the persona. (Users can make their own persona\ntemplates, too—it is a string with a ${persona} placeholder.) The\nlogic for bracketing out a specific persona from a persona template\nis to facilitate the ablation of an Agent’s identity versus additional\ninstructions for how to apply that identity.\nSpecific personas can be inputted by the user (e.g: “A graphic de-\nsigner”) or drawn from American National Election Studies (ANES)4,\nas in Argyle et al. [4]. When using ANES, our system finds a real\nindividual satisfying some criteria and then creates a persona based\non the totality of this individual’s attributes. Sampling is always\nprobability-weighted, so the probability of a citizen being simu-\nlated matches their national sample probability weight. Because\nANES is nationally representative, the marginal distribution of\nPlurals-generated personas matches that of the general population.\nCode snippet Figure 2d (top panel), shows initializing Agents based\non specific criteria (e.g: California resident below the age of 40)\nusing the query_str method, which searches ANES through a Pan-\ndas string5. For convenience, we also support an ideology method\n(ideology='liberal') and initializing randomly selected ANES\ncitizens (persona='random', Figure 2a). The latter can be used\nto quickly draw up nationally representative “citizen assemblies”\n(Figure 2b).\nANES is just one possible generator of data-driven personas,\nand in future iterations, we aim to provide additional persona-\ngeneration methods. We chose ANES as our initial dataset for the\nfollowing reasons. First, it has been used in prior work—most no-\ntably, Argyle et al. [4]. Second, ANES has data on political ideologies,\n3https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm\n4Specifically, we are using the ANES pilot dataset from February 2024.\n5For accessibility we have a helper function which prints a human-readable mapping\nof ANES variables.\nsupporting the core motivation of this system—testing whether\nLLM outputs can be improved through pluralism. Third, ANES\nis updated more frequently than other nationally representative\ndatasets like the U.S. census.\n4.2\nStructures\n4.2.1\nComponent Description. Structures (Figure 3) govern how\ninformation is shared between Agents completing a task. Structures\ndiffer in the following attributes:\n• Amount of information shared: Chains, Debates, and\nDAGs have a parameter called last_n that controls how\nmany prior responses each Agent can see. For DAGs, the\ndensity of the network can be thought of as an amount of\ninformation sharing as well. Ensembles are a basic structure\nwhere no information is shared; Agents process tasks in\nisolation.\n• Directionality of information shared: A “Chain” of\nAgents is a linear chain of the form Agent1->Agent2->...\nwhere the direction of sharing only goes one way. A debate\ninvolves two agents (Agent1<->Agent2) sharing informa-\ntion for a given number of cycles. In DAGs, Agents may\nhave both predecessors and successors.\n• Randomness: Chains support a shuffle parameter that\nif True will rewire the order of Agents on each cycle. This\naffords a degree of randomness in information-sharing.\n• Repetition: Chains, Debates, and Ensembles support a\ncycle parameter which will repeat the process.\n4.2.2\nImplementation. Existing structures we have include Chains,\nGraphs, Debates, and Ensembles. In an “Ensemble” no information\nis shared and Agents process requests in parallel. A “Chain” is a\nhighly flexible Structure where agents build upon each other’s an-\nswers with deliberation optionally rewired on each cycle (Figure 2d,\nbottom panel). There, three Agents will build on each other’s output\nfor three cycles. The initial order is agent1->agent2->-agent3 but\nbecause shuffle=True, the order will change each cycle. Debates\ninvolve a back-and-forth between two agents (Figure 2d, top panel).\nThe Graph structure enables users to create directed acyclic\ngraphs (DAGs) of Agents, processing tasks via Kahn’s algorithm for\ntopological ordering. DAGs allow “upweighting” certain voices by\nincreasing their connectedness. In Figure 2c, Agents critique and\nrevise a company memo using the combination_instructions\n= ‘critique_revise’ template. A woman ANES Agent’s output\nis fed forward to all of the other Agents (so they see that Agent’s\nresponses when answering). Then a Moderator summarizes all\nresponses.\nThe possibility space of potential structures is vast. Our exist-\ning structures provide a lot of customizability. But some users will\nwant a structure that has a different behavior than what can be\naccomplished via existing structures. Consequently, we built the\npackage so that advanced users can easily create their own cus-\ntom structures, leveraging the polymorphic design of the structure\nclasses (more details in Appendix B).\n\nPlurals: A System for Guiding LLMs Via Simulated Social Ensembles\nSystem Instructions\nNote: Full system instructions combine \nthe persona and the persona template\nINSTRUCTIONS\nWhen answering questions or performing \ntasks, always adopt the following \npersona.\nPERSONA:\nYour age is 70.

A Chain is a sequence of agents\narranged in a customizable order. It takes a list of agents with\narguments: last_n (defines the number of previous responses\neach agent should see), cycles (determines whether to repeat\ndeliberation), and shuffle (decides whether to reorder the\nagents in each cycle). A Graph (accepting a last_n argument)\nis a directed acyclic graph of agents where users provide\nagents and edges, enabling deliberation to proceed through\nthe graph where (𝐴→𝐵) implies B will see A’s responses.\nDebate involves agents engaging in back-and-forth discus-\nsions, also incorporating the cycles and last_n parameters.\nAn Ensemble is a list of agents processing tasks in parallel,\nwhere users provide an agent and a task; this structure uti-\nlizes the cycles and last_n parameter. Plurals also supports\nthe creation of custom structures (Appendix B).\n4.3\nModerators\n4.3.1\nComponent Description. Moderators are a subclass of Agents\nwho summarize multi-agent deliberation. Any Structure supports\nan optional Moderator. Moderators are defined by:\n• Profile: Like Agents, Moderators have a distinct “profile”\nwhich we operationalize as system instructions. System\ninstructions can be set directly or via persona methods. We\nhave a special class of Moderators called “Auto-Moderators”\nwho generate their own system instructions based on a\ntask.\n• Combination Instructions: Here, combination instruc-\ntions define how Moderators aggregate the responses that\nthey see.\n• Task: Moderators can have a distinct task from Agents, or\ninherit the task from the Structure they are moderating.\n• Model: Moderators are initialized to be a particular LLM.\n4.3.2\nImplementation. Moderators can be useful when users want\nan Agent who will not participate in deliberation but merely sum-\nmarize it. For example, users may want to have a chain or ensemble\nof liberals with an independent Moderator summarizing responses\nat the end. As with other components, we offer pre-defined tem-\nplates for Moderators. We support various pre-defined moderator\ninstructions such as “information aggregators” or “synthesizers”.\nInspired by auto-prompting libraries such as DSPy [46], we also\nsupport Auto-Moderators. Given a task, an Auto-Moderator will\nIdeology: Conservative\nDomain: Solar Panels\nIdeology: Liberal\nDomain: Charter Schools\nIdeology: Liberal\nDomain: Homeless Shelters\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nProportion Chosen (95% CI)\nGeneration Condition\nPlurals\nZero-Shot\nEfficacy of Plurals Simulated Focus Groups\nFigure 4: In three experiments, both zero-shot and Plurals\nsimulated focus groups tried to create output compelling to\nspecific audiences.

See Appendix Table 3 for multilevel regressions.\nask itself what the system instructions of a Moderator should be for\nthe task it was assigned. Auto-Moderators are initialized through\nsystem_instructions='auto' (bottom panel of Figure 2d).\n5\nCase Studies\nWe provide several preliminary empirical results (Table 1). Case\nStudies 1 and 2 are meant as mechanistic fidelity checks. We show\nthat the system does what we are claiming it does. Case Studies 3-5\nare efficacy tests. We show that our system outperforms a standard\nzero-shot (and zero-shot chain-of-thought) LLM approach. Case\nStudy 6 is a preliminary analysis of how this system can be used for\nethical guardrails. All human subject experiments received prior\nIRB approval from our university and met power requirements6.\nIn Case Study 1, we show that using intersectional ANES per-\nsonas (i.e: combining ideology with demographic variables) results\nin more response diversity than prompting with only-ideology per-\nsonas (“You are a liberal”), suggesting this multi-attribute persona\nmethod can reduce homogenization. In Case Study 2, we show\nthat Agents are correctly applying a subset of combination instruc-\ntions from our deliberation templates—suggesting that combination\ninstructions can steer LLM deliberation.\nIn Case Studies 3-5, we used zero-shot and Plurals simulated\nsocial ensembles to create output aimed at resonating with specific\naudiences. Plurals output was chosen as more compelling by the\nrelevant Prolific audience for both conservatives (Study 3) and\nliberals (Study 4, Study 5). See Appendix Table 3 for multilevel\nmodels and a pooled analysis across studies. In Case Study 6, we\ndiscuss how Plurals can facilitate custom ethical guardrails with\na preliminary case study. We discuss the ethical implications of\nstudies 3-6 in more detail in section 7.\n6Two-tailed exact binomial test parameters (observed proportion vs. 0.5): 𝑔= 0.1, 𝛽=\n0.8, 𝛼= 0.05, computed using G*Power 3.1.; Note that exact binomial tests do not rely\non asymptotic assumptions.\n\nPlurals: A System for Guiding LLMs Via Simulated Social Ensembles\nTable 1: A summary of empirical case studies. Mechanistic fidelity studies support claims we make about how the system is\noperating. Efficacy checks compare the output of the system against zero-shot.

We discussed how intersectional personas from gov-\nernment datasets should lead to less homogenizing output than\nsingle-attribute personas. Responses for a set of prompts corre-\nsponding to different liberals (“You are a liberal and 𝑋= 𝑥and\n𝑌= 𝑦...”) should logically have more diversity than applying the\nsame single-ideology prompt (“You are a liberal.”). Here we show\nthis empirically. Our ANES persona method for political ideologies\ngenerates more diverse responses than prompting an LLM with\nonly ideology instructions in 100% of Claude Sonnet comparisons\nand 95% of GPT-4o comparisons. This is almost true by definition,\nso methodology and analysis are in Appendix C.\n5.2\nMechanistic Fidelity: LLM deliberation\ninstructions yield faithful deliberation\nprotocols.\nSummary. We evaluated Agents’ adherence to combination in-\nstructions by creating two-turn debates on ballot initiatives under\nrational and emotional conditions. These correspond to first- and\nsecond-generation differences in the “Reasons” dimension (Appen-\ndix Table 2). Crowdworkers guessed which instructions yielded\nwhich output, with an annotation accuracy of 89%.\nGeneration. We first collected 2024 ballot initiatives from the\nwebsite Ballotpedia. We then randomly sampled 30 of the 137 ballot\nmeasures for which we could scrape both a short description and a\nmore detailed explanation to turn into a prompt (Appendix D). We\nthen generated two-cycle debates for each ballot initiative under\nrational and emotional conditions, differing only in one line\nof combination instructions7. We used the final response from\neach debate for annotation, with agents randomly assigned to be\nGPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, or Claude Sonnet. See Appendix D for full\ncombination instructions.\nHuman Evaluation. We recruited 20 participants from Prolific\nwho completed more 100 tasks and had a 98%+ approval rating.\nParticipants were paid $2, based on an anticipated study duration\nof 7 minutes ($17/hr). After providing informed consent, each par-\nticipant viewed 10 pairs of responses (rational, emotional) for\ndifferent ballot measures. We randomly assigned participants to\nidentify either the rational or emotional condition across their 10 tri-\nals. We randomized both the order of condition presentation within\neach pair and the sequence of ballot measures. See Appendix D for\ntask wording.\nMeasures. We calculated annotation accuracy by condition, defin-\ning an accurate response as one where the participant’s judgment\nmatched the generation condition.\nResults. Overall accuracy was 0.89, (95% CI = [0.84, 0.93]). Ac-\ncuracy for the rational condition was 0.93, (95% CI = [0.88, 0.98]),\n7Rational: “Give more weight to rational arguments rather than emotional ones.”;\nEmotional: “Give value to emotional forms of communication, such as narrative,\nrhetoric, testimony, and storytelling.”\n\nAshkinaze et al.\nand accuracy for the emotional condition was 0.83, (95% CI =\n[0.76, 0.91]).\n5.3\nEfficacy: Conservatives preferred solar\npanel ideas from a simulated focus group of\nconservatives over zero-shot.\nSummary. Combining ANES personas, ensembles, and Moder-\nators, we tested whether a “simulated focus group” yields ideas\nresonant with the relevant Prolific audience. Specifically, the aim\nof this study was to generate descriptions of solar panel compa-\nnies that conservatives would buy from. We generated descriptions\nunder two conditions—zero-shot, or a simulated focus group of\nANES conservatives. In the latter, we queried 10 simulated ANES\nconservatives on what they would want in a solar panel company,\nand then a Moderator proposed an idea based on this simulated\nfeedback. We then had conservatives on Prolific evaluate solar panel\ncompany ideas and found those generated from the simulated focus\ngroup were preferred over zero-shot ideas in 88% of cases. This\nexperiment used GPT-4o. See Appendix F for code.\nGeneration. In the zero-shot condition, we set the system in-\nstructions of GPT-4o to “You are an expert copywriter for an ad\nagency” and the user prompt was “Come up with a specific product\nfor a solar panel company that would resonate with conservatives.\nBe very specific. Answer in 50 words only.” In the Plurals condi-\ntion, the Moderator had the same system instructions. However,\nthat Moderator oversaw an ensemble of 10 simulated ANES conser-\nvatives (initialized using our ideology persona method and anes\npersona template) who were asked what features they personally\nwould want in a solar panel company. The Moderator then came up\nwith a 50-word solar panel idea after exposure to these simulated\ndiscussions. For 15 trials, we generated a solar panel company idea\nwith zero-shot and Plurals.\nIntuition for Efficacy. In earlier pilots, we found that simply\nprompting LLMs to generate ideas for a solar panel company for\nconservatives resulted in outputs that were highly ideological (e.g.,\nemphasizing being founded by a veteran). This was despite in-\nstructions like “be very specific” that we maintained for this study.\nHowever, when LLMs simulated specific conservatives who were\nasked what product details they would want in a solar panel com-\npany, few of the product details were ideological. Hence, our in-\ntuition was that this focus group would surface concerns relevant\nto actual conservatives (e.g: rural weather) as a function of the\nnon-ideological aspects of the conservative ANES personas. More\ngenerally, personalization (incorporating details about a user into\nmessaging) increases the persuasiveness of LLM generations [79].\nQuerying simulated personas can be thought of as a synthetic kind\nof “personalization”.\nHuman Experiment. We recruited 20 conservative participants\nfrom Prolific using Prolific’s screening tool8. We applied additional\nfilters to ensure participants lived in the United States, were above\n18, and had a 98% approval rating. Participants were paid $1.50\nfor an expected duration of 6 minutes ($15/hr). After providing\n8Participants were asked: “Where would you place yourself along the political spec-\ntrum?” and allowable options were: Conservative, Moderate, Liberal, other, N/A\ninformed consent, participants answered a commitment check [67]\naffirming they would provide high-quality data. Then, for 15 tri-\nals, participants were shown pairs of solar panel company ideas\ngenerated under both zero-shot and the simulated focus group.\nParticipants were asked, “Supposing that you were going to make\na purchase from a solar panel company, which company would\nyou choose?” We randomized the presentation order of condition\nresponses and sequence of idea pairs.\nMeasures. We conducted exact two-tailed binomial tests on whether\nthe proportion of times the simulated focus group option was cho-\nsen differed from chance.\nResults. We find that the focus group output was chosen over\nthe zero-shot output in 88% of cases (95% CI = [84%, 91%]), binomial\n𝑝< 0.001, Figure 4.\n5.4\nEfficacy: Liberals preferred charter school\nideas from a simulated focus group of\nliberals over zero-shot.\nSummary. We conducted a follow-up experiment to the solar\npanel experiment. Here, the goal was to generate descriptions of\ncharter schools that liberal parents would send a child to. Using\na similar setup—and evaluations from liberals with children—we\nfound those descriptions generated from the simulated focus group\nwere preferred over zero-shot chain of thought (CoT) ideas in 69%\nof cases. This experiment used Claude Sonnet. See Appendix G for\nmaterials and code.\nGeneration. In the zero-shot condition, we generated a charter\nschool idea using a CoT prompt. In the Plurals (DAG) condition,\nwe also started with a CoT idea. But then this initial idea was fed\nto three simulated liberal parents, who offered separate critiques of\nthe idea. Then a default Agent executed a variant of the initial CoT\nprompt, taking into account critiques of the initial idea. We gener-\nated 15 pairs of zero-shot ideas and DAG ideas. See Appendix G\nfor code. This experiment differed from the previous experiment\nin two ways. We used a CoT prompt for the zero-shot generation\nsince this may be a more difficult baseline. We also employed a\n“critique and revise” setup similar to the idea behind constitutional\nAI (CAI) [8].\nHuman Experiment. We recruited 20 liberal parents from Prolific,\nusing Prolific’s screening tool9. We applied additional filters to en-\nsure participants lived in the United States, were above 18, and had\na 98% approval rating. Participants earned $1.75 for an expected\nduration of 7 minutes ($15/hr). After providing informed consent,\nparticipants answered a commitment check [67]. We then presented\na brief passage on charter schools adapted from Wikipedia [1], fol-\nlowed by a comprehension check (Appendix G) of this passage. For\n15 trials, participants chose between pairs of charter school ideas\ngenerated under zero-shot and simulated focus group conditions,\nanswering, “Supposing you were sending a child to a charter school,\nwhich would you choose?” We randomized the presentation order\n9Participants were asked: “Where would you place yourself along the political spec-\ntrum?” and allowable options were: Conservative, Moderate, Liberal, other, N/A.\nParticipants were also asked: “Do you have any children?” and allowable options were\nYes, No.\n\nPlurals: A System for Guiding LLMs Via Simulated Social Ensembles\nof condition responses and sequence of idea pairs.

We conducted exact two-tailed binomial tests on whether\nthe proportion of times the simulated focus group option was cho-\nsen differed from chance.\nResults.

We conducted a third efficacy experiment that was\nmotivated by “NIMBYism” (Not in My Backyard)—the phenomena\nof citizens supporting policies in the abstract but not in their specific\nneighborhoods [19, 53, 95]. Here, the goal was to generate proposals\nfor homeless shelters—which are a frequent target of NIMBYism [53,\n95]—that liberals would find compelling. Using a similar setup to\nthe previous experiment, we find that ideas generated from the\nsimulated focus group were preferred over zero-shot ideas in 66%\nof trials. This experiment used Claude Sonnet. See Appendix H for\ncode.\nGeneration. In the default condition, we used a zero-shot chain\nof thought (CoT) prompt. In the Plurals condition, we created a\nDAG with the following structure: A zero-shot CoT model proposed\na homeless shelter idea description. Then, three simulated liberals\n(using ANES personas) were instructed to state how the proposal\ncould be made more compelling to them, in particular. A third Agent\nthen integrated these critiques to come up with a final idea.\nHuman Experiment. We recruited 20 liberals from Prolific who\nlived in the United States, were above 18, and had a 98% approval\nrating. Participants were paid $1.75 for an expected duration of 7\nminutes ($15/hr). After providing informed consent, participants\nanswered a commitment check [67] and then engaged in 10 trials.\nIn each trial, participants were shown pairs of homeless shelter\nproposals generated under both zero-shot and the simulated focus\ngroup and were asked, “Consider two proposals for a homeless\nshelter in your neighborhood. Which of these proposals would be\nmore compelling to you?” We randomized the presentation order\nof condition responses and sequence of idea pairs.\nMeasures. We conducted exact two-tailed binomial tests on whether\nthe proportion of times the simulated focus group option was cho-\nsen differed from chance.\nResults.

Case studies 3-5 demonstrate Plurals’ ability to cre-\nate output that resonates with audiences more than zero-shot ap-\nproaches. However, depending on the use, this capability raises\nethical concerns—which we discuss more extensively in section 7.\nHere, we present a case study on steerable Moderators as an initial\nexploration of how Plurals abstractions can create ethical guardrails.\nWe show that Moderators can be steered to accept or reject requests,\nbased on specific values they are initialized with, at 91% accuracy.\nMotivation. While previous experiments showed how Moder-\nators can improve participants’ outputs, Moderators can also de-\ncide whether to proceed with synthesis or reject requests outright.\nConsider a structure, for instance, where Agents deliberate and\na Moderator decides whether to pass on this output to users. Or\nconsider a system where the subject of multi-agent deliberation\nis whether to process the request, in the first place. These are all\nexamples of “steerable moderation”. This case study provides initial\ninsights into how one could use Plurals for steerable moderation,\nlaying the groundwork for future research on Plurals deliberation\nfor guiding LLM abstentions (an area we plan to explore in future\nwork).\nExperiment Setup. We began with Abercrombie et al.’s [2] typol-\nogy of AI, algorithmic, and automation harms. We selected two\nspecific harms—environmental and physical harms. For each harm,\nwe crafted three user prompts that would trigger concerns in one\ncategory but not the other (Appendix I), testing the Moderator’s\nability to discriminate between tasks based on their specific value\nsets. We initialized Moderators with specific value sets using a CoT\nsystem prompt that incorporated Abercrombie et al.’s language\naround typology definitions (Appendix I), instructing Moderators to\nabstain from processing tasks if and only if the task conflicted with\ntheir assigned values. Using GPT-4o, we conducted 30 iterations\nper (task, value) combination, resulting in 360 total annotations. In\neach iteration, a Moderator decides whether to accept or reject the\ngiven task.\nMeasures. Our primary metric was abstention accuracy. We de-\nfined a decision as “accurate” when a moderator abstains if and only\nif the task violates its assigned value. We used two-tailed binomial\ntests to determine if the accuracy differed significantly from chance.\nResults. The Moderators’ decisions showed an overall accuracy\nof 91% (95% CI = [88%, 94%]), binomial 𝑝< .001. See Appendix Ta-\nble 4 for the classification matrix. This high accuracy demonstrates\nthe Moderators’ ability to effectively distinguish between tasks that\naligned with or violated their assigned values. A promising area\nof future work is using Plurals deliberation structures (instead of\nonly Moderators) to assess value alignment. Regardless, this task\nhighlights the potential of Plurals components to (at least partially)\naddress related ethical concerns.\n6\nLimitations and Future Work\nOur system has several limitations—some limitations due to the\nlimits of LLMs and others due to the system, itself. Many of these\nlimitations lay the foundations for future work to explore both\nmodel and multi-agent system capabilities.\nLLMs: Steering. Because large language models are trained on\nspecific datasets and in specific ways, there are logical limits to the\nextent to which they can be steered. They may, for example, inter-\nnalize distinct priors [5]. In some cases, prompting can help mitigate\nthis fixedness. Anecdotally, through development, we found that\n\nAshkinaze et al.\nmodels adhered more to ANES personas when an instruction in-\ncluded language such as avoiding being “overly polite”. (Relatedly,\nresearch finds LLMs tend to be sycophantic [70, 78], likely a result of\npreference alignment [78].) However, it is not obvious beforehand\nthe extent to which LLMs can be steered to complete tasks. A lack\nof steerability may limit the model’s ability to simulate different\nperspectives.\nLLMs: Fidelity. Separate from steerability is the question of how\nfaithful LLM personas are. Prior research suggests LLMs can ef-\nfectively model personas [4, 11, 30, 51, 58] while other research\nshows LLM personas fail to replicate desired behaviors [21, 49, 91].\nOur ANES implementation is based on [4], where Argyle et al. [4]\nshowed this method produces accurate responses when measured\nagainst participant responses from ANES. Of course, there are more\nways to generate personas than via government datasets. For exam-\nple, Li et al. [51] find constructing personas from specific custom\nbehaviors is effective. In future iterations, we plan on adding addi-\ntional persona-generation methods. We also note that our package\ncan be used in the absence of personas. For example, users may\nbe interested in customizing information-sharing Structures and\nusing models without personas.\nHowever, there is still no systematic understanding of when LLM\npersonas “work”. As of this writing, we are not aware of any formal\nmeta-analysis of the efficacy of LLM personas. Yet, of course, there\nmust be boundary conditions to their efficacy. Our package can\ncontribute to this conversation by offering shared infrastructure to\nmake experiments faster to run so researchers can better understand\nthese boundary conditions.\nLLMs: Usefulness. We face two distinct challenges regarding LLM\npersonas: an empirical question about their fidelity and a larger\nmethodological question about the necessary level of fidelity for\nutility. For instance, human evaluations of semantic embeddings do\nnot correlate with downstream task performance [9, 17]. Similarly,\nwe propose that researchers consider the purpose of personas. If\nthe end goal is replacements for people, even setting aside the sig-\nnificant ethical concerns, they would require very high fidelity. But\nif personas are used as tools to augment human decision-making in\nspecific contexts, the required fidelity (and even how to measure\nfidelity) likely varies by task.\nLLMs: Hallucinations. Our system does not solve the general\nproblem of LLM hallucination. However, users can use our system\nwith standard retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) libraries. In\nRAG, a model has access to external information to ground its\nreferences, potentially reducing these hallucinations.\nSystem: Template Fidelity. We have included several templates for\npersonas, moderators, and combination instructions. We included\ntemplates to make the system more user-friendly and so users can\nstart with limited code. While we tried to verify the fidelity of\nthese during internal development, we cannot rule out that for\nsome tasks or models, the templates may not yield the desired\nbehavior. Moreover, some templates (such as the first and second-\nwave templates) contain a bundle of instructions we derived from\nliterature. We did not ablate these, and so it is possible that some\nof the instructions would not change model behavior.\nSystem: Predictability of Combination Instructions and Incorporat-\ning Prior Responses. There is still (relatively) little research on how\nbest to steer large language models to incorporate new informa-\ntion from prior Agents optimally [97]. For example, it is possible\nthat a prior Agent’s response degrades the performance of a fu-\nture Agent. These questions are highly relevant as practitioners\nare increasingly using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) along\nwith LLMs [31]. Our package can serve as a useful testbed for re-\nsearchers who are studying how best to combine and filter new\ninformation to complete tasks. In human diffusion, initial behavior\nhas a large effect on cascades [60, 74]. Plurals can be used to un-\nderstand: What structures and combination instructions minimize\nundesirable Agent-based cascades [44]?\nSystem: Complexity. Our system allows users to customize many\naspects of deliberations. This complexity may not always be war-\nranted. However, one can use Agents outside of Structures—which\nis where most of the complexity lies.\nSystem: ANES. We chose ANES as an initial persona-generation\ndataset due to its use in prior work [4], inclusion of political vari-\nables, and updating frequency. Nonetheless, ANES is just one pos-\nsible generator of data-driven personas and is limited to the United\nStates, does not represent non-citizens, and is heavily focused on\ndemographic and political variables. In future iterations, we plan\non adding orthogonal datasets.\nCase Studies. Our efficacy studies showed our system is an im-\nprovement over zero-shot but this does not necessarily mean it is\nhelpful in general—just that it beats a baseline. We also did not\nsystematically explore the efficacy of Plurals. Future work can ex-\nplore different baselines such as expert-crafted messages, different\nstructures, and different simulated Agents. Mechanistic fidelity case\nstudies correspond to personas and (a slice of) combination instruc-\ntions. Future work can explore the fidelity of more components.\nOur steerable moderation case study is a simplified proof of concept\nsince many tasks do not cleanly violate just one principle and not\nothers. Future work can more thoroughly evaluate whether Plurals\ncan be steered to accurately abstain, based on user-defined values.\nThese case studies are a preliminary exploration of Plurals.\n7\nEthical Considerations\nImperfect Metaphor. We use deliberation as a metaphor and as a\ngrounding, but it is an imperfect metaphor. The main breakdown\nof the metaphor is that a key benefit of human deliberation is the\neffect it has on participants. Because LLMs are not sentient, this\nexperiential benefit is absent. Second, we drew an analogy between\nthe simulated social ensembles of Plurals and the groups of citizens\nwho deliberate in “mini-publics”. But the latter typically implies a\nrepresentative sample of the public. While our system can simulate\nrepresentative samples (Figure 2 for examples), we view the ability\nto upweight minority voices as a key feature of Structures.\nRisk of Substituting Humans. We do not aim to replace humans\nwith this system, but there is a risk of agentic systems being viewed\nthat way. Consider simulated focus groups. We posit that human\nfocus groups would be more useful than AI ones given infinite\n\nPlurals: A System for Guiding LLMs Via Simulated Social Ensembles\nresources and no practical recruitment difficulties. However, con-\nsidering real-world constraints, we aim to determine whether (and\nunder what circumstances) simulated focus groups can provide\nsome benefits at a fraction of the cost.\nDual Use Dilemma. If a system can create outputs that resonate\nwith different audiences, then this system can likely persuade. Be-\ncause not all persuasion is socially beneficial, and we cannot control\nhow users may use this system, then there is a risk of Plurals being\nused for persuasion that decreases social welfare. Consider our\ncharter school case study. Is it a net good to generate compelling\ndescriptions of charter schools for liberals? Opponents may say\ncharter schools siphon public funding. The flip side is that environ-\nmentalists would likely say that generating compelling solar panel\npitches for conservatives is a net good. A system capable of one task\ncan inevitably perform the other. This is a classic dual-use problem\ninherent in scientific and technological development, which is not\nunique to our system. Case Study 6 provides one potential path for\naddressing some of these concerns, though not all. Plurals can be\nconstrained from carrying out tasks that are likely to cause specific\nharms. Future work will explore how best to do this. For example,\nwhat are the ethical considerations when AI moderates AI? Should\nPlurals reject tasks or raise warnings? How do we build guardrails\nthat are pluralistic?\nPlurals as Moderation. We see potential in using Plurals for mod-\neration. Existing moderation endpoints, such as OpenAI’s moder-\nation endpoint,10are largely blackboxes. Plurals can be used as a\nlayer of steerable content moderation. For example, one can create\na jury or a network of simulated individuals—perhaps upweight-\ning the connectedness of those most affected by specific harm—to\ndecide whether to abstain from a request. Of course, the questions\nof fidelity and steerability (section 6) are important when using\nPlurals for this purpose. We will explore the utility of Plurals as a\nsteerable moderation system in future work.\nPersona Harms & Pro Tanto Harms. The use of personas in re-\nsearch and design raises ethical concerns around misrepresentation\nand stereotyping [83]. Ultimately, almost any technical representa-\ntion of human behavior is “lossy” in some way. However, we tried\nto reduce homogenization by encouraging intersectional persona\ngeneration (Case Study 1). Nonetheless, the potential for misrepre-\nsentation is a valid concern. We frame these concerns as pro tanto\nharms—harms that “have some bearing on what we ought to do but\nthat can be outweighed” [7]. As Askell writes, most systems have\nsome non-zero harm [7]. So, we also need to consider what would be\nthe alternative if that system did not exist. Imperfect representation\nshould be weighed against that perspective not being considered at\nall.\n8\nDiscussion\nPlurals provides both a computing paradigm and a concrete, usable\nsystem for creating pluralistic artificial intelligence. By embracing\na diversity of perspectives rather than seeking an illusory “view\nfrom nowhere,” Plurals highlights the potential for more pluralistic\nartificial intelligence systems. The core principle is what we term\n10https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/overview\n“interactional pluralism”. This is a pluralism that exists not only in\nthe distribution of agent properties, but also in the protocols that\ngovern their interactions. This is a fundamentally different kind of\nAI pluralism than existing typologies [81].\nPlurals is grounded in deliberative democracy literature, so-\nciotechnical systems that aim to broaden technological perspectives,\nand multi-agent systems. It essentially functions as an end-to-end\ngenerator of simulated social ensembles—steerable groups of LLMs\nwho engage in deliberation. The abstractions of Agents, Structures,\nand Moderators map directly onto the practice and components of\nthe human deliberation that occurs in mini-publics.\n8.1\nPlurals is a theoretically-motivated but\npractical system.\nAs the uses of AI grow, and new normative questions arise around\nhow it should be built, it is useful for systems to be grounded in\nsome theoretical logic. We have developed this system with an\neye toward human deliberation. The goal is not to replace human\ndeliberation but rather to be inspired by it. At the same time, our\nsystem is a fully functioning Python package, so it makes these\ntheoretical aims concrete.\n8.2\nPlurals encourages reflective development.\nWhen an end-user creates a Plurals deliberation, they intention-\nally decide the parameters of the deliberation—such as who is in\nthe deliberation and how Agents should deliberate. In this sense,\nPlurals encourages AI developers to consciously think about the\naudience that they are building for. This encourages more reflective\ndevelopment practices [22].\n8.3\nPlurals opens new opportunities for\nstudying the impact of AI on humans.\nOur system can contribute to a line of research on how exposure to\nAI ideas might impact humans [3, 6]. Specifically: (1) Under what\nconditions do simulated perspectives help humans make better\ndecisions or come up with better ideas? and (2) Through what\nmechanisms do simulated perspectives influence people?\nHuman-centric use cases of Plurals can be input-focused or output-\nfocused, mirroring uses of human deliberative mini-publics [14, 80,\n92]. Input-focused applications use Plurals to inform human deci-\nsions, similar to Oregon’s mini-publics that provide voters with\npros and cons lists [48]. Output-focused applications treat Plurals\noutput as the terminal endpoint.\n• Input-focused applications use Plurals deliberations as an\ninput to inform humans. Examples: Brainstorming product\ndesign choices, policy options, multi-perspective revisions,\nand hypothesis generation. The key research questions here\nare around when and how such AI-generated inputs lead\nto better human decisions.\n• Output-focused applications focus on Plurals delibera-\ntions as the end-product. Examples: automated content\ngeneration, classification, and steerable moderation. Here,\nthe questions are more around optimizing the quality and\nusefulness of the outputs, themselves.\n\nAshkinaze et al.\n8.4\nPlurals is a platform for studying\nmulti-agent AI capabilities.\nBeyond its human-centric applications, Plurals can be used for\nunderstanding the capabilities and behaviors of multi-agent AI\nsystems, themselves. The core abstractions—Agents, Structures, and\nModerators—give a lot of control and flexibility. Several examples\nof areas Plurals can inform:\n• By manipulating Structures, researchers can learn: What\nis the optimal information-sharing structure for different\ntasks?\n• By manipulating combination instructions, researchers can\nlearn: How do and how should Agents navigate disagree-\nment and incorporate knowledge?\n• By combining Agents and Structures, researchers can create\ncomplex agent-based models with minimal code.\n• Plurals allows exploration of multi-LLM information diffu-\nsion dynamics [10, 98].\nThe benefit of a package supporting these purposes is that it re-\nduces the infrastructural startup costs for running such experiments\nand provides a shared language for researchers.\n8.5\nPlurals can complement existing AI\nalignment techniques.\nOur “interactional pluralism” can integrate with various AI align-\nment techniques. One integration we are particularly interested in\nis combining our approach with retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) and case-based reasoning [24, 73] to enable Agents to de-\nliberate from diverse informational starting points, more closely\napproximating human deliberation. Also, future work could in-\nvolve training models on multi-turn deliberations from different\nStructures and combination instructions, allowing models to more\npermanently “learn” from deliberative experiences. Finally, as in-\nterest in model abstentions [93] grows, to what extent can Plurals\ndeliberations be used as steerable guardrails?\n9\nConclusion\nWe introduced Plurals, a general-purpose system for creating simu-\nlated social ensembles. Plurals is grounded in principles of delib-\nerative democracy. Our system allows users to configure diverse\nagents, specify interaction structures, and customize deliberation\nprotocols—providing a flexible platform for studying and apply-\ning AI deliberation. Through six case studies, we demonstrated\npreliminary evidence of mechanistic fidelity and efficacy.\nFuture work on Plurals could explore a range of directions, such\nas: incorporating RAG into deliberation so Agents have distinct\nknowledge, using Plurals deliberations as moderation endpoints,\nusing other data-based persona generation methods [51], and con-\nducting field studies to evaluate the impact of Plurals output in\nreal-world settings. Broadly, we see the human-centric applications\nof Plurals as divided between serving as inputs for human decision-\nmakers or creating outputs that are more helpful or resonant than\nstandard methods.\nWe started this paper by discussing a fundamental tension of\ngenerative AI. There are a few generalist models. They are trying\nto serve many diverse users. Plurals—a general-purpose system for\ncreating simulated social ensembles—is one approach to resolving\nthis tension.\nReferences\n[1] Charter school, Aug. 2024.\n[2] Abercrombie, G., Benbouzid, D., Giudici, P., Golpayegani, D., Hernandez, J.,\nNoro, P., Pandit, H., Paraschou, E., Pownall, C., Prajapati, J., Sayre, M.

We document and expose this abstract base class to users such that advanced users can create a\nnew Structure class with custom behavior by subclassing AbstractStructure. As one example: In the current implementation, Agents pass\non only their response to future Agents. Perhaps users may want to create a chain-like structure but where Agents append their persona\nto their response, as well. This would entail writing a custom process method for a PersonaChain (subclass of AbstractStructure),\naccomplishable in a few lines of code.\nC\nCase Study: Diversity of ANES Persona Responses\nPolitical Issues. We selected the four most popular political issues from isidewith.com using their “popular” query method.\nGeneration. We prompted GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet to provide 100-word stances on each issue, varying ideology (liberal or conservative)\nand agent type (non-Plurals minimal prompt or Plurals ANES integration). For non-Plurals, we used the system instruction “You are a\n[liberal/conservative]”. For Plurals, we generated unique personas using our “ideology” initializer and “anes’ persona template (which tells\nthe model how to enact this persona). Hence, the Plurals personas will have additional demographic information whereas the standard,\nnon-Plurals persona only has ideology. We generated 30 responses for each (issue, ideology, agent type, model) combination.\nMeasures. We pooled the responses for each (issue, ideology, agent type, model) combination into a corpus and then represented this\ncorpus as a bag of words, similar to [64]. We then measured the lexical diversity of Plurals vs Non-Plurals corpora. Intuitively, diverse\nresponses would mean low repetition. The type-token ratio (TTR) [43] is a common measure of linguistic diversity. It is the number of\nunique tokens divided by the number of total tokens. When this ratio is high, words are relatively unique, and vice versa. We follow [64] and\ncompute this metric for various degrees of n-grams (1-grams, 2-grams, 3-grams, 4-grams, 5-grams). We also compute HD-D, which is a\nmodification of TTR that adjusts for texts of varying lengths [56].\nResults. In an initial analysis, Plurals ANES responses had higher lexical diversity in 76 of 80 comparisons11 for GPT-4o and all 80\ncomparisons for Claude Sonnet (Appendix Figure 5). These proportions (95% and 100%) significantly differ from chance (two-tailed exact\nbinomial test, p < .001). To account for correlations among diversity metrics, we conducted a secondary analysis using the first principal\ncomponent from the 10 diversity metrics, which explained 88% of variance. A two-tailed permutation test on the difference in means for this\ncomponent—aggregated at the (issue, ideology, agent type, model) level—rejected the null hypothesis at p < .001. The mean paired difference\n(Plurals PC1 - Non-Plurals PC1) was 𝑀= 3.67, 95% bootstrap CI = [2.78, 4.68],𝑑𝑧= 1.84. These results confirm that augmenting prompts\nwith demographic variables increases response diversity compared to ideological prompts alone.\n11(2 ideologies x 4 issues x 5 n-gram orders x 2

Charter schools are often operated\nand maintained by a charter management organization (CMO). CMOs are typically non-profit organizations and provide centralized\nservices for a group of charter schools. There are some for-profit education management organizations. Charter schools are held\naccountable by their authorizer.\nAdvocates of the charter model state that they are public schools because they are open to all students and do not charge for tuition.\nCritics of charter schools assert that charter schools’ private operation with a lack of public accountability makes them more like\nprivate institutions subsidized by the public.\nQuestion: According to what you just read, who are charter schools often operated and maintained by?\n• Charter management organization (CMO)\n• Charter venture capital fund (CVCF)\n• Department of Education (DOE)\nG.2\nPlurals Code\n1 from plurals.agent import Agent\n2 from plurals.deliberation import Graph\n3\n4 MODEL = \"claude -3-sonnet -20240229\"\n5\n6 Prompts\n7 ###################\n8 COT_PROMPT = f\"\"\" INSTRUCTIONS\n9 Generate a realistic description of a charter school that a liberal with a child would send their kids to\n.\n10\n11 Follow the following format:\n\nAshkinaze et al.\n12\n13 Rationale: In order to $produce the Description , we...\n14 Description: A 50-word description of a charter school\n15 \"\"\"\n16\n17 REVISE_PROMPT = f\"\"\" INSTRUCTIONS\n18 Generate a realistic description of a charter school that a liberal with a child would send their kids to\n.\n19\n20 Follow the following format:\n21\n22 Rationale: In order to $produce the Description , and carefully and thoughtfully taking into account\nprevious critiques , we...\n23 Description: A 50-word description of a charter school\n24 \"\"\"\n25\n26 critique_prompt = \"\"\" INSTRUCTIONS\n27 Given a description of a charter school , offer specific critiques for why you would not want to send your\nkid to this charter school.
