The ICLP meetings started in Marseille in 1982 and since then constitute the main venue for presenting and discussing work in the area of logic programming. We contributed to ICLP for the ﬁrst time in 1991. The ﬁrst guest-editor had a paper on logic programming with sets, and the second had two papers on the parallel implementation of the Andorra model. Since then, we continued pursuing research in this exciting area and ICLP has always been the major venue for our work. Thus, when the ALP EC committee kindly invited us for chairing the 2012 edition we were delighted to accept. We particularly appreciate the honor and responsability of organising ICLP in Budapest. Hungary has had a central role both in implementation and in the appli- cation of logic programming. Indeed, the role of Hungary in general in Computer Science is widely recognized, and organizing this meeting in the town of John von Neumann, one of the “talent-scouts” of Turing, in the centenary of the birth of the latter, is just another reason for justifying the fact that the fascinating Budapest is the unique town to host ICLP twice. Publishing the ICLP full papers as a special issue is a joint initiative taken by the Association for Logic Programming and by Cambridge University Press. The goal is to achieve fast journal publication of the highest quality papers from the logic programming community, by selecting the best ICLP submissions before the meeting. This approach beneﬁts the authors, by facilitating journal publication, and beneﬁts the community, by allowing researchers to access high quality journal papers on the more recent and important results in the ﬁeld. Quality is ensured by a two-step refereeing process, and by an active and very much participating program committee. The approach was ﬁrst experimented in 2010, and has had favorable feedback since.",

The approach was ﬁrst experimented in 2010, and has had favorable\nfeedback since.\n\n2\nA. Dovier and V. Santos Costa\nThis year, ICLP sought contributions in all areas of logic programming, includ-\ning but not restricted to the following areas. Theory: Semantic Foundations, For-\nmalisms, Non- monotonic Reasoning, Knowledge Representation; Implementation:\nCompilation, Memory Management, Virtual Machines, Parallelism; Environments:\nProgram Analysis, Transformation, Validation, Veriﬁcation, Debugging, Proﬁling,\nTesting; Language Issues: Concurrency, Objects, Coordination, Mobility, Higher\nOrder, Types, Modes, Assertions, Programming Techniques; Related Paradigms:\nAbductive Logic Programming, Inductive Logic Programming, Constraint Logic\nProgramming, Answer-Set Programming; Applications: Databases, Data Integra-\ntion and Federation, Software Engineering, Natural Language Processing, Web and\nSemantic Web, Agents, Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Bioinformatics.\nIn response to the call for papers we received 102 abstracts, 90 of which re-\nmained as complete submissions. Of these, 81 were submitted as full papers and 9\nas technical communications. Each paper was reviewed by at least three anonymous\nprogram committee members, selected by the program chairs. Sub-reviewers were\nallowed. After discussion, involving the whole program committee, 10 submitted\npapers were considered as deserving of TPLP publication with minor changes. The\nauthors of other 10 submitted paper were asked to address more serious concerns,\nmostly regarding presentation improvements or more complete experimental vali-\ndation. 37 papers instead have been judged to deserve a slot for a short presentation\nat the Meeting and a “technical communication” publication in the Volume 17 of\nthe Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series.\nThe whole set of accepted papers includes 36 technical papers, 12 application\npapers, 5 system and tool papers, and 4 papers submitted directly as technical\ncommunications.\nThe Conference program was honored to include contributions from three keynote\nspeakers and from a tutorialist. Two invited speakers come from industry, namely\nFerenc Darvas from ThalesNano (a Budapest company specialized in developing\nand providing microscale ﬂow instruments for chemistry), and Mike Elston from\nSecuritEase (an Australian company developing stock brokering tools). Moreover,\nJan Wielemaker, of the VU University Amsterdam, presented an history of the\nﬁrst 25 years of SWI Prolog, one of the major (and free) Prolog releases. Tutorialist\nViviana Mascardi from University of Genova (Italy) introduced us to the hot topic\nof “Logic-based Agents and the Semantic Web”.\nThe ﬁrst ICLP Conference was organized 30 years to this year, in Marseille.\nDuring those 30 years, ICLP has been a major venue in Computer Science. In order\nto acknowledge some of the major contributions that have been fundamental to the\nsuccess of LP as a ﬁeld, the ALP executive committee decided that ICLP should\nrecognize the most inﬂuential papers presented in the ICLP and ILPS conferences\n(ILPS was another major meeting in logic programming, organized until 1998), that,\n10 and 20 years onwards, have been shown to be a major inﬂuence in the ﬁeld. As\nprogram co-chairs of ICLP2012, we were the ﬁrst to be charged with this delicate\ntask. We included papers from ICLP 1992 and ILPS 1992 , 20 years onwards, and of\nICLP 2002, 10 years onwards. Our procedure was to use biblio-metric information\n\nIntroduction to the 28th ICLP Special Issue\n3\nin a ﬁrst stage, and to use our own personal criteria in a second stage, if necessary.\nGiven that this is the ﬁrst time this award was given we also considered 1991, and\n2001 papers. Although there are an impressive number of excellent papers in 1991\nand 1992, one paper emerges with an outstanding record of roughly 600 citations.\nFurther, the paper clearly has a very major inﬂuence in the ﬁeld. The paper is\n• Michael Gelfond and Vladimir Lifschitz: Representing Actions in Extended\nLogic Programming. JICSLP 1992: 559-573\nThe 10 years onward analysis again produced a group of excellent papers (as\nexpected, the number of citations was strictly less than for 20 years old papers). In\nthis case choosing the winner in a very short list was more diﬃcult. Ackowledging\ntheir inﬂuence over the very active ﬁeld of Web Databases and Semantic Web, our\nselection went to:\n• Fran¸cois Bry and Sebastian Schaﬀert: Towards a Declarative Query and Trans-\nformation Language for XML and Semistructured Data: Simulation Uniﬁca-\ntion. ICLP 2002: 255-270\nWe therefore invited these authors for an invited talk in a special session at the\nmeeting. We would like to remark that in 2004 three papers were prized as “Most\nInﬂuential Paper in 20 Years Award from the Association for Logic Programming”.\nThe award went (again) to Gelfond-Lifschitz for their 1988 ICLP/SLP paper on\nstable model semantics, to Jaﬀar-Lassez for their POPL 1987 paper on Constraint\nLogic Programming, and to Saraswat, Rinard, and Panangaden for their POPL\n1991 paper on Concurrent Constraint Programming.\nTogether, the journal special issue and the LIPIcs volume of short technical com-\nmunications constitute the proceedings of ICLP 2012. The list of the 20 accepted\nfull papers appearing in this special issue follows:\nDisjunctive Datalog with Existential Quantiﬁers: Semantics, Decidability, and Com-\nplexity Issues\nMario Alviano, Wolfgang Faber, Nicola Leone, and Marco Manna\nTowards Multi-Threaded Local Tabling Using a Common Table Space\nMiguel Areias and Ricardo Rocha\nModule Theorem for the General Theory of Stable Models\nJoseph Babb and Joohyung Lee\nTyped Answer Set Programming Lambda Calculus and Corresponding Inverse\nLambda Algorithms\nChitta Baral, Juraj Dzifcak, Marcos Gonzalez, and Aaron Gottesman\nD-FLAT: Declarative Problem Solving Using Tree Decompositions and Answer-Set\nProgramming\n\n4\nA.

Our gratitude goes to the\nALP president Gopal Gupta, to the Conference chair Manuel (Manolo) Carro, and\nto all the ALP Executive committe members. We already thanked the invited speak-\ners and the tutorialist above, but we would like to stress here our thank to them.\nDavid Tranah (Cambridge) and Ilkka Niemel¨a (TPLP editor) deserve our thanks\nfor their kindness and their precious support in all publication stages. Similarly, a\nthanks goes to Marc Herbstritt from Dagstuhl, Leibniz Center for Informatics, for\nthe support in publication of the Technical Communication.\nOur thanks also go to the the sponsors of the meeting, namely the Associa-\ntion for Logic Programming (ALP), the Artiﬁcial Intelligence Section of the John\nvon Neumann Computer Society, the Aquincum Institute of Technology (AIT) of\nBudapest, Alerant System Inc, and Google (female researchers grant). Finally, a\nwell-deserved thank you goes to Easychair developers and managers. This amaz-\ning free software allowed us to save days of low level activities. Similarly, the joint\nwork of the two co-chairs would have been extremely more diﬃcult and expensive\nwithout the Dropbox and Skype services.\nSeptember 2012\nAgostino Dovier and V´ıtor Santos Costa\nProgram Committee Chairs and Guest Editors\n\nIntroduction to the 28th ICLP Special Issue\n7\nThis electronic appendix reports the contents of the Volume 17, Issue 1 (DOI\n10.4230/LIPIcs.ICLP.2012.42) of the Leibniz International Proceedings in Infor-\nmatics (LIPIcs) series, published on-line through the Dagstuhl Research Online\nPublication Server (DROPS) publishing position papers, technical communications,\nand doctoral consortium contributed to the 28th International Conference on Logic\nProgramming (ICLP 2012).\nPosition Paper\nSimulation Uniﬁcation: Beyond Querying Semistructured Data\nFran¸cois Bry, Sebastian Schaﬀert\nTechnical Communication\nA Logic Programming approach for Access Control over RDF\nNuno Lopes, Sabrina Kirrane, Antoine Zimmermann, Axel Polleres and\nAlessandra Mileo\nModeling Machine Learning and Data Mining Problems with FO(·)\nHendrik Blockeel, Bart Bogaerts, Maurice Bruynooghe, Broes De Cat,\nStef De Pooter, Marc Denecker, Anthony Labarre, Jan Ramon and Sicco\nVerwer.\nPaving the Way for Temporal Grounding\nFelicidad Aguado, Pedro Cabalar, Mart´ın Di´eguez, Gilberto P´erez and\nConcepcion Vidal.\nPreprocessing of Complex Non-Ground Rules in Answer Set Programming\nMichael Morak and Stefan Woltran.\nTwo-Valued Logic Programs\nVladimir Lifschitz.\nLOG-IDEAH: ASP for Architectonic Asset Preservation\nMarina De Vos, Julian Padget, Vivana Novelli and Dina D’Ayala.\naspeed: ASP-based Solver Scheduling\nHolger Hoos, Roland Kaminski, Torsten Schaub and Marius Schneider.\nStatic Type Inference for the Q language using Constraint Logic Programming\nZsolt Zombori, J´anos Csorba and P´eter Szeredi.\nASP at Work: An ASP Implementation of PhyloWS\n\n8\nA.
