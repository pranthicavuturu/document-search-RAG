And ﬁnally, improved coordination between\nuniversities, industry, and government agencies can facilitate\ngreater opportunities to push the ﬁeld forward. The rest of this\narticle brieﬂy summarizes these three themes, and concludes\nwith a discussion of promising directions.\nII. HUMANS AND AI WORKING TOGETHER\nAlthough many large-scale manufacturing processes are\nautomated to some degree, there are always humans involved\nat multiple levels. The humans may be physically interact-\ning with the system (e.g., loading parts into a machine) or\ninteracting through a computer (e.g., deﬁning the production\nschedule). Different Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) have dif-\nferent expertise, some may have a deep technical knowledge of\na speciﬁc process such as maintenance of a speciﬁc machine,\nwhile others may have a broader understanding of a system.\nHumans are expected to be adaptable, and able to react to\nboth small disturbances (slightly out-of-order product ﬂow)\nand large changes (new product arriving).\nMost AI deployed in manufacturing plants today is rela-\ntively ﬁxed, i.e., it does not have the ability to learn beyond\nwhat it has been trained to do, nor can it ask questions when\nit does not understand what to do. The panel felt that there\nwas a signiﬁcant opportunity to develop AI that can work in a\nmore integrated fashion with SMEs, at different levels, perhaps\nanswering questions posed by the SME and even posing ques-\ntions when something becomes uncertain. While some AI tools\narXiv:2303.11139v1  [eess.SY]  20 Mar 2023\n\n2\nthat take input from a human have been developed for data-\nscience applications (e.g., Google VisionAI), these capabilities\nneed to be extended to the manufacturing environment. In this\nway, the knowledge held by the SMEs can be leveraged with\nthe knowledge in the AI, and no human knowledge will be\nleft behind. This integration of SME and AI can also lead to\nbetter trust of the AI by the SME, so that the AI is seen as\na tool to help get the job done well, empowering the SME\nrather than threatening to eliminate the job.\nMany currently-deployed AI systems in manufacturing de-\ntect anomalies that occur, things that are out of the ordi-\nnary, which can lead to preventing poor quality or machine\nbreakdown. However, in many cases, the anomaly detection\njust alerts an operator, who is called over to investigate the\nsituation, and make a decision about the appropriate response\n(ignore, shutdown, repair, etc). Most of these solutions are\ndeveloped in a speciﬁc domain, using SMEs knowledgeable\nabout the process. Generalizing these solutions to new domains\nis difﬁcult, and generally requires new SMEs to be engaged.\nCould an AI be developed that would facilitate this type of\ngeneralization? What would it need to learn and where would\nit get the information?\nIn many manufacturing plants today, although robots and\nhumans may work together to accomplish a job, they do not\nwork in close proximity nor do they request knowledge from\neach other. They are separated due to safety constraints, with\nthe robots sequestered in cages. Newer collaborative robots\ncan operate safely around humans, although they are gener-\nally restricted to move slower than their caged counterparts.\nDespite closer proximity, collaborative robots do not request\nadditional information from a human when new or unfamiliar\nchallenges arise. As perception technologies improve, there are\nopportunities for AI to help robots and humans work together\non physical tasks such as assembly. This could help address\nthe challenge of personalized production.\nAs we move into the era of human-centric, sustainable\nmanufacturing [3], questions of cooperation between humans\nand AI become increasingly more important. One question\nthat was raised was whether it was essential to differentiate\nbetween human and artiﬁcial intelligence. From a manufactur-\ning system perspective, would it be possible to start looking\nat any intelligent system (humans, robots, computers, etc.) as\nan intelligent agent with speciﬁc capabilities? By blurring the\nline between human and artiﬁcial intelligence, we can start to\ndevelop an evolutionary process to support learning resulting\nfrom a continuum of human and AI knowledge.\nIII. INFRASTRUCTURE FOR AI IN MANUFACTURING\nManufacturing systems are incredibly complex. From the\nnonlinear physics of low-level processes (welding, 3D print-\ning) to the material handling within a plant, scheduling, and\nsupply chain, everything needs to come together for a high-\nquality part to be produced and delivered to a consumer. There\nare hundreds of thousands of variables, of different types, and\nmeasured at different sample rates, that interact in diverse ways\nto describe what is happening. Many manufacturing plants\noperate multiple shifts per day, or even 24/7, leading to huge\nvolumes of data. There are thousands or even millions of\ndifferent things that can happen. AI technology needs data\nto learn, and although there is a lot of data to be found in\nmanufacturing systems, it is not always AI-ready. Or, even\nthough there is a lot of data, it may not be sufﬁciently\ndiverse and capture enough samples of important events to\ndevelop effective learning and intelligence applications. In\nshort, most data management systems were not developed or\nput in place with AI in mind (e.g., maintenance management\ndatabases), and so they are not AI ready in terms of many\ndata quality dimensions (e.g., accuracy, freshness, granularity,\nvolume/archive length, variety, and context richness).\nData is collected through sensors, and the panelists spent\nsome time discussing the limitations of current sensing in\nmanufacturing. In many cases, the sensors do not measure\nthe variable of interest, limiting the ability for AI to learn a\nmodel of the process. For additive manufacturing or welding\nprocesses, the sensor can only measure what is on the surface\nand not the important material characteristics underneath. For\nsome manipulation processes, only vision is available without\nany haptic or tactile feedback. Some sensors, such as thermal\nimaging cameras, can return huge amounts of data, which can\nbe a challenge to process.\nAI problems require massive amounts of data, and the\nprocess of obtaining that data is expensive. Although manufac-\nturing companies have a lot of data, they typically do not have\nthe amount of data required for many AI approaches. Further,\nmanufacturing companies are reluctant to share their data,\ndue to its proprietary nature, reducing the potential for sup-\nplementing the data through additional resources. The panel\ndiscussed the advantages of industry-university partnerships to\nshare information (e.g., data, pre-competitive model forms).\nEfforts to standardize the anonymization of information to\npreserve the underlying characteristics for different types of\nAI and learning would also be useful.\nAs discussed in Section II, there is a big need to de-\nvelop techniques that allow humans and AI technology to\ncollaboratively work on tasks in the manufacturing system.\nHowever, the panelists also identiﬁed that there is a signiﬁcant\ninfrastructure challenge that needs to be addressed before\nhumans and AI can effectively work together. Examples were\nprovided where SMEs are expected to be both/either at the\nfront end of the AI technology (e.g., setting up the bounds for\nanomaly detection) and/or the back end of the AI technology\n(e.g., analyzing the information provided by the AI tool).\nHowever, the interfaces may have been developed for a speciﬁc\ntype of worker/SME. How can manufacturers start to develop\ngeneralizable interfaces that enable a comfortable working\nenvironment for the human? Can interfaces be developed that\nallow the human and AI to work on the tasks that each one\nis good at? How can AI be enhanced to the point of asking\nfor information when necessary and accepting information\nasynchronously?\nIV. DEVELOPING INDUSTRY-UNIVERSITY\nCOLLABORATIONS\nThe panelists have experience in industry, academia, and\ngovernment. The panel recognized that most of the identiﬁed\n\n3\nchallenges, from improving the AI infrastructure to developing\nnew technology, cannot be solved by a single institution and\nmust include collaborations between industry, academia, and\nthe government. Companies will often have the technology and\ncan identify real-world manufacturing problems that would\nbeneﬁt from the integration of AI. Universities provide the\neducation infrastructure to develop the manufacturing work-\nforce and the research capabilities that allow researchers to\naddress various challenges. The government can foster these\ncollaborations through programs that identify the need and\nprovide funding for for AI in manufacturing. The need to\nincorporate the workforce (e.g., operators and SMEs) into the\nresearch discussions was also recognized. As AI technology is\ndeveloped for the manufacturing sector, training tools for the\nworkforce must be developed to improve the integration of\nnew manufacturing AI technology. It will also be important to\nmotivate the people working in the manufacturing environment\nto adopt and use AI technology for their work.\nWhile AI has been recognized as a pivotal technology for\ngrowth and innovation for manufacturing [4], industry has\nbeen slow to adopt AI technology within the manufacturing\nenvironment. Some of the factors that contribute to this slow\nadoption of AI technology include issues with the economy of\nscale. A lot of solutions to research problems are speciﬁc and\ncannot be scaled to the rest of the manufacturing enterprise\ndue to cost and time constraints. As mentioned above, to\nadvance AI solutions, there is a need for manufacturers to\nshare data. Partnerships between universities and industry,\nwith government support, can help with data and information\nsharing, such as developing improved data anonymization\ntechniques and changing the cultural perspective of data shar-\ning in manufacturing.\nV. PROMISING DIRECTIONS\nThe panel discussed ideas about how to push the manufac-\nturing ﬁeld toward a more fully integrated paradigm of AI\ntechnology in manufacturing systems. The advancement of\nmanufacturing system technology (e.g, Industrial Internet of\nThings, collaborative robots) and the rise of customer expec-\ntations for customization and production capabilities provides\nan opportunity for the integration of AI in the manufacturing\nsystem industry. While a number of challenges were identiﬁed\nfor the full integration of AI in manufacturing systems, there\nare a number of promising directions for this growing area.\nIndustry, academia, and government agencies recognize the\nneed for developing collaborations and programs that can\nfacilitate improved adoption of AI in the manufacturing en-\nvironment. Manufacturing scheduling and planning was one\nof the identiﬁed high-value, target research areas that can\nbe targeted with AI technology. The panel believed that the\nscheduling and planning process can be improved through AI\ntechnology due to the signiﬁcant amount of data available and\nthe large opportunity for productivity improvement, especially\nwhen moving towards personalized production. The need for\nimproving the reusability and extensibility of AI solutions\nvia digital twin technology was also mentioned as a topic\nof interest [5]. Another key research area identiﬁed by all\nmembers of the panel was the need to integrate subject-matter\nexpertise into AI technologies deployed in the manufacturing\ndomain at all levels. Both human and artiﬁcial intelligence are\nneeded to realize the promise of high-quality, high-volume,\nlow-cost personalized production systems. The discussion in\nthis panel aligned with the research directions and oppor-\ntunities that have been identiﬁed in existing literature. For\nexample, the need to leverage technological advancements\nto help create human-centric and eco-centric manufacturing\nsystems has recently been identiﬁed as a topic of interest by\na number of other researchers in the area of smart manu-\nfacturing [3], [6]–[8]. Note that while the panel discussion\ndescribed in this manuscript covered a wide array of topics,\nthere were a number of important research areas, such as the\nuse of digitization and virtual manufacturing [9] and the role\nof robots and cobots [10], that were only brieﬂy mentioned\nand could beneﬁt from future discussions on challenges and\nopportunities.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank the MECC organizers [1] for the\nopportunity to present the special session. We would also\nlike to thank the panelists and audience for their thoughtful\ncomments and participation in the session.\nREFERENCES\n[1] “Modeling, estimation and control conference.” [Online].
