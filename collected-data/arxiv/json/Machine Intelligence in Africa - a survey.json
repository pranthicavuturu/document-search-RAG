The confusion arising from associating the term “intelligence” with few\nillustrative machine learning applications, influenced by science fiction and MI\nbusiness narratives, has led to widespread uncertainty and, in some cases, fear.\nTo unlock the potential benefits that MI holds for Africa, it is imperative to\ncommence an educational journey for the general public, creating a foundation\nof informed and knowledgeable users of MI systems. This broader understand-\ning will, in turn, contribute to nurturing the technical professionals and highly\nskilled specialists necessary to propel the countries’ ambitious MI plans forward.\nInitiating general public awareness efforts must begin at the grassroots levels of\nsociety, ensuring that programs and content are accessible even to those with\nlimited or no formal education. Recognizing the prevalence of informal edu-\ncation in many African countries, a variety of courses and training programs\nshould be tailored to assist recipients in ascending the capacity-building pyra-\nmid. Designing general public awareness programs that are easily consumable\nis key, primarily through short videos, brief audios in local languages, or inter-\nactive tradition-inspired games. These formats aim to help the audience grasp\nfundamental MI concepts and distinguish between myth and reality.\nRegrettably, up to now, the educational journey for the general African public\nremains inaccessible due to the absence of machine intelligence that supports the\nlocal language - an audio-rich language in many areas.\nHere the objective is not to rank countries by their MI strategy. Some very\nsmall MI projects had very big social impact in the local population and some\nsignificant MI Innovation had almost no impact for the local population so far.\nWhat we learn from basic game theory and Pareto optimality is that when mul-\ntiple interdependent objectives are involved as it is the case in MI, the scalar-\nization technique which maps the vector of objectives into a single number, is\nnot necessarily a good idea. This can be observed from the fact that the vector\n(1, 0) is not better than (0, 1) and vice-versa. These vector elements are often\nreplaced by the well-being elements of the local population, which include mon-\netary, non-monetary, technological, non-technological, technical, non-technical,\nempathetic, etc, which are not captured by a single number.\nLiterature Review\nIn [10], the authors examine MI in Africa with a special focus on challenges and\nopportunities. The developments in MI have the potential to disrupt and trans-\nform socio-economic activities across industries. The countries in the Global\nSouth such as those in Africa need to tackle governance issues and lack of in-\nstitutional capacity to establish the building blocks to allow MI to flourish for\nthem by them. It is important to also examine the roles of international commu-\nnities in bridging the technological gaps in Africa by adopting a problem-driven\napproach where local needs and problems are contextualized into MI policy for-\nmulation rather than a blanket copy-and-paste practice that has limited the\nadvancement of development policies in Africa.\nA problem-driven approach\nwould help African countries to formulate robust MI policies that are relevant\nto their unique circumstances.\n2\n\nThe deployment of basic MI technologies is proliferating on the African con-\ntinent, but policy responses are still at their early stages. The work in [11] pro-\nvides an overview of the main elements of MI deployment in Africa, MI’s core\nbenefits and challenges in African settings, and MI’s core policy dimensions for\nthe continent. The authors argued that for MI to build, rather than undermine,\nsocio-economic inclusion in African settings, policymakers need to be cognisant\nof the following key dimensions: gender equity, cultural and linguistic diversity,\nand labour market shifts.\nThe work in [12] proposes a decolonized appropriation of MI in Africa. Tech-\nnocoloniality occurs when the use of technology reinforces a colonial mindset,\naiming to assert power, control, and domination, often replicating historical\npatterns of oppression. Take digital technologies like the internet and mobile\nphones, for instance, which are deeply intertwined with the legacy of colonial-\nism. This integration, originating from the West, has been imposed on other\nregions, notably the African continent. An illustration is the mobile app ’Free\nBasics’ by Facebook, allowing users limited access to certain websites without\ndata charges. However, many of these accessible sites promote services of pri-\nvate US companies and are not available in major African languages. This app\nhas faced significant criticism as a manifestation of digital colonialism.\nDespite dominant narratives discouraging anthropomorphizing MI, Shoko\nSuzuki argues against universal models for our attitudes towards MI [13]. We\nargue here that the same applies to MI ethics. We should not expect to have\na one-size-fits-all in ethics.\nWithin Africa, we should not expect to have a\none-size-fits-all ethics either.\nFrom a regional perspective, several studies have shown that machine learn-\ning technology can help address some of Africa’s most pervasive problems, such\nas poverty alleviation, improving education, delivering quality healthcare ser-\nvices, and addressing sustainability challenges like food security and climate\nchange. In [14] , a critical bibliometric analysis study is conducted, coupled\nwith an extensive literature survey on recent developments and associated ap-\nplications in machine learning research with a perspective on Africa. The pre-\nsented bibliometric analysis study consists of 2761 machine learning-related doc-\numents, of which 89% were articles with at least 482 citations published in 903\njournals during the past three decades. Furthermore, the collated documents\nwere retrieved from the Science Citation Index Expanded , comprising research\npublications from 54 African countries between 1993 and 2021. The bibliomet-\nric study shows the visualization of the current landscape and future trends\nin machine learning research and its application to facilitate future collabora-\ntive research and knowledge exchange among authors from different research\ninstitutions scattered across the African continent.\nAgriculture is considered as the main source of food, employment and eco-\nnomic development in most African countries and beyond. In agricultural pro-\nduction, increasing quality and quantity of yield while reducing operating costs\nis key. To safeguard sustainability of the agricultural sector in Africa and glob-\nally, farmers need to overcome different challenges faced and efficiently use the\navailable limited resources. Use of technology has proved to help farmers find\n3\n\nsolutions for different challenges and make maximum use of the available lim-\nited resources. Blockchains, internet of things and machine learning innovations\nare benefiting farmers to overcome different challenges and make good use of\nresources. In [15] , a wide-ranging review of recent studies devoted to applica-\ntions of internet of things and machine learning in agricultural production in\nAfrica is presented. The studies reviewed focus on precision farming, animal\nand environmental condition monitoring, pests and crop disease detection and\nprediction, weather forecasting and classification, and prediction and estimation\nof soil properties. The work in [16] explores the realization of MI potential in\nAfrica, emphasizing the pivotal role of trust. The work in [17] discusses the\nfailure of mass-mediated feminist scholarship in Africa, highlighting normalized\nbody-objectification as a consequence of MI. The work in [18] focuses on using\nartificial intelligence for diabetic retinopathy screening in Africa. The work in\n[19] delves into ethical considerations surrounding the implementation of arti-\nficial intelligence in Africa’s healthcare. The work in [20] investigates the use\nand impact of MI on climate change adaptation in Africa. The work in [21]\nmaps policy and capacity for MI development in Africa. The authors in [22]\nexplore the role of information and communication technologies, including MI,\nin the fight against money laundering in Africa. The work in [23] addresses the\nmalicious use of MI in Sub-Saharan Africa, posing challenges for Pan-African\ncybersecurity. The work in [24] conducts a needs assessment survey for artifi-\ncial intelligence in Africa. The work in [25] discusses the integration of MI in\nmedical imaging practice from the perspectives of African radiographers. The\nauthors in [26] outline an agenda for journalism research on artificial intelligence\nin Africa. The work in [27] explores the ethics of MI in Africa, focusing on the\nrule of education. The work in [28] examines artificial intelligence policies in\nAfrica over the next five years. The work in [29] discusses machine ethics and\nAfrican identities, offering perspectives on MI in Africa. In [30] the authors\nadvocates scaling up MI to curb infectious diseases in Africa. The work in [31]\naddresses emerging challenges of artificial intelligence in Africa, presented in the\ncontext of responsible MI. The work in [32] scrutinizes China’s role as a ’digital\ncolonizer’ in Africa, focusing on MI’s impact.\nThe paper in [33] assesses the effect of information and communication tech-\nnologies on the informal economy. The authors applied the Generalized Method\nof Moments on a sample of 45 African countries from 2000 to 2017. According to\nthe findings, the use of ICTs (mobile phone and internet) decreases the spread\nof the informal economy in Africa. These results are robust to a battery of\nrobustness checks. Furthermore, the results of the mediation analysis show that\nthe effect of ICTs on the informal economy is mediated by financial develop-\nment, human capital and control of corruption. From a policy perspective, the\nauthors suggested a quantitative and qualitative consolidation of technological\ninfrastructures, for a sustainable mitigation of the rise of the informal sector in\nAfrica.\nIn the context of the African continent, machine learning has been used\nin ecology [38], gold mining [39], education [40], construction [41], electricity\n[42], mineral resources [43], wheat [44], optical network [45], Teaching [46], fact-\n4\n\nchecking [47], news production [48], digital humanism [49], music [50], farming\n[51], low-resource languages [52], architecture [53], clinical prediction [54], text-\nbased emotion [55], audio-based emotion [56], Computer Vision Community for\nAfricans and by Africans [57, 58].\nContribution\nThe objective of this article is to present some advances in MI research, MI\nuse cases in small businesses, and government actions in Africa. In countries,\nwhenever available, we also highlight MI in industry, art, music, and the infor-\nmal economy. As we will see, each country has its intrinsic path and cultural\nadaptation to MI and other emerging technologies such as Graphchains and the\nInternet of People.\nTable 1: Some countries with a national MI strategy as of December 2023\nCountry\nExplicit national MI Strategy reported\nAlgeria\n✓2021\nSenegal\n✓2023\nBenin\n✓2023\nRwanda\n✓2023\nMauritius\n✓2019\nNigeria\n✓2023\nEgypt\n✓2021\nTunisia\n✓2022\nSeychelles\n✓2019\nSome key findings are below:\n• Some MI strategies (see Table 1) are dictated from outside the African\ncontinent, and some meetings are organized in very expensive hotels where\nthe local population cannot afford a single night in a lifetime. Some reports\nand recommendations are made after those meetings. Unfortunately, most\nof these efforts have zero impact in the field and are almost useless to the\nlocal population, as they are not aware of them, except for a few selected\npeople surrounding the funding on MI.\n• We have carefully reviewed over 400 research articles on the use cases of MI\nin Africa (see Fig. 1). Most of the applications are at the testing level on a\nsmall dataset, with manipulated targets, and some are clearly overselling\ntheir findings.\nA random forest does not provide a magical output as\nclaimed by many of these papers. As the MI field has made progress in\nterms of algorithms, designs, robustness, convergence, and learnability,\nthese studies need to be updated to more practical MI algorithms than\nthese random searches.\n• Ranking African countries by a single uniform weighting average index is\nclearly unethical, as it does not take into account data transparency and\n5\n\nconcrete actions taken by

In\nthe informal economy, leveraging MI technologies is proposed to redefine tax\npolicies, assess incentives for agriculture, and enhance electronic transactions,\ncontributing to a regulated formal economy. At the governmental level, Algeria\nhas adopted a national strategy on research and innovation in MI, inaugurated\nthe National School for Artificial Intelligence (ENSIA), and declared 2023 as\n’The Year of Artificial Intelligence’, showcasing a comprehensive approach to\nadvancing skills and leveraging MI in key socio-economic sectors.\nAlgeria\n2020-2023\nConcrete Actions\nResearch\n✓\nENSIA, RAWATIB\nSMB\n✓\nAkilliCon,\nDalil,\nTransformaTek\nInformal\nEconomy\n✓\nData 1980-2017\nGovernment ✓\n2021:\n100-page white\npaper on national MI\nstrategy\nTable 2: MI in Algeria\n2.1.1\nResearch\nThe study in [59] underscores the pivotal role of economic intelligence as a cru-\ncial mechanism in fostering the growth and development of small and medium\nenterprises in Algeria. For these enterprises, success hinges on their ability to\naccess high-quality and timely information, enabling them to navigate a rapidly\nchanging environment, anticipate shifts, and make optimal decisions for their\nsurvival. The study argues that integrating economic intelligence mechanisms\ninto SMEs is not just beneficial but an imperative necessity for their develop-\nment, support, and enhanced competitiveness. Through a descriptive approach\nthat emphasizes the need for information transfer, analysis, and drawing from\nvarious sources, the results affirm the significant contribution of economic intel-\nligence to the competitiveness, innovation, and strategic development of small\nand medium enterprises, empowering them to effectively face risks and bolster\ndecision-making.\nIn the context of Algeria’s economic landscape, the study\nemphasizes the symbiotic relationship between economic intelligence and the\nMI-driven economy, particularly within the realm of small and medium busi-\nnesses. The integration of these intelligence mechanisms becomes a strategic\nimperative, aligning with the broader national strategy for economic develop-\nment. As Algeria looks towards the future, the study suggests that the synergy\nbetween economic intelligence and MI holds substantial potential for propelling\n15\n\nthe growth and resilience of SMEs, thereby contributing to the overall economic\nvitality of the country.\n2.1.2\nSmall Businesses\nAlgiers serves as a focal point for MI-powered platforms like RAWATIB, Akil-\nliCon, Dalil, and TransformaTek, contributing to the emergence of MI-enabled\nsmall and medium businesses in Algeria. RAWATIB is an MI-powered SaaS\nplatform that streamlines payroll and human resources management for busi-\nnesses of all sizes. The platform automates many administrative tasks involved\nin payroll and HR management, reducing the risk of errors and saving busi-\nnesses time and resources. AkilliCon is a low-cost, low-profile Ambient Energy\nHarvester Terminal that can be used alone with AkilliCon specified Battery as\na Power Bank. Dalil is a company focused on object recognition and navigation\nsystems for visually impaired people. Imagine this: your friend invited you to\ndinner at a new restaurant downtown, but to get there, you need to go to the\nbus stop, take bus number 128 to the train station, and take the train into the\ncity. Easy enough, right? Now, imagine making that trip without being able to\nsee. It is a challenge that 314 million visually impaired people face every day.\nEven with expert mobility skills and the use of a cane or a guiding dog, naviga-\ntion, environment detection, and recognition can be stressful. TransformaTek\nis a startup working toward the widespread adoption of location intelligence\ntechnologies by small businesses. Our mission is to develop community-driven\nplatforms to democratize access to open geospatial datasets and build useful use\ncases for businesses.\n2.1.3\nInformal Economy\nThis research work [63] examines Algeria’s informal economy through a com-\nprehensive analysis employing the Multiple Indicator Multiple Causes approach.\nThe primary objectives include investigating key determinants, estimating size\nand development, examining short and long-term relationships with the formal\neconomy, and unraveling causality directions from 1980 to 2017. Findings re-\nveal that the tax burden, the agricultural sector, the quality of institutions,\nand GDP per capita emerge as pivotal determinants shaping the contours of\nthe IE in Algeria. Understanding these factors becomes imperative for crafting\neffective strategies to address the informal sector. The study indicates that the\ninformal economy constitutes an average of 33.48% of the official GDP, wit-\nnessing a steady increase over the past 15 years.\nInterestingly, the research\nuncovers a nuanced relationship between the informal and formal economies.\nIn the short run, the IE exerts a positive impact on the formal economy, while\nin the long run, this effect undergoes a reversal. Understanding these dynam-\nics is crucial for policymakers in devising interventions that promote sustainable\neconomic growth.To mitigate the size of the informal economy in Algeria, a mul-\ntifaceted approach is proposed. Leveraging MI technologies can play a pivotal\nrole in redefining tax policies, reassessing incentives for the agricultural sector,\n16\n\nand fostering the widespread adoption of electronic transactions. MI-powered\nsolutions can enhance efficiency, transparency, and compliance in economic ac-\ntivities, contributing to a more regulated and inclusive formal economy.\n2.1.4\nGovernment\nIn 2019, Algeria organized a workshop on MI. Participants in a workshop for\nthe preparation of the national strategic plan for MI 2020-2030 recommended,\nin Constantine, the development of a white paper on this technology to estab-\nlish economic intelligence in the country. The creation of a white paper on MI\nserves as a roadmap to determine the appropriate mechanisms for the introduc-\ntion of this technology into various socio-economic sectors, aiming to achieve\neconomic intelligence, according to the consensus of the 150+ Algerian MI ex-\nperts, including 30 researchers working abroad, gathered at the National School\nof Biotechnology at Salah Boubnider Constantine University. Subsequently, a\n100-page white paper was presented to the public in 2021. Algeria has adopted\na national strategy on research and innovation in MI, dedicated to improving\nAlgerians’ skills in MI through education, training, and research, and exploiting\nthe potential of MI as a development tool in key socio-economic sectors (e.g.\neducation, health, transport, energy). In the 2021-2022 academic year, Algeria\ninaugurated the National School for Artificial Intelligence (ENSIA) [62] to admit\nhigh school graduates interested in this field. The school is tailored to educate\nengineers in the theories and applications of MI and data science. Students will\nlearn to develop and publish practical and innovative solutions for challenges\nin sectors such as health, energy, agriculture, and transportation, thereby con-\ntributing to the country’s scientific and economic advancement. The House of\nArtificial Intelligence [61] comprises 13 universities nationwide and supervises\n40 MI research projects. The Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Re-\nsearch, announced 2023 as ”The Year of MI”, on January 10th at The National\nSchool of Artificial Intelligence (ENSIA).\n2.2\nEgypt\nEgypt has undergone a transformative journey in deploying MI from 2000 to\n2023, marked by the innovative endeavors of companies like NileCode, AT-\nInstruments, and FastAutomate.

Areas of interest may include, but not limited\nto, machine learning, deep learning, information retrieval, computer vision, in-\ntelligent machines, robotics, Internet of Things, wireless sensor networks, cloud\ncomputing, computer science, hardware implementation, image processing and\nvideo processing (see [65]).\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of education,\nthe integration of MI has emerged as a transformative force. The scientific re-\nsearch work [66] presents MI applications in educational settings, specifically\nfocusing on the acceptance and adoption of these cutting-edge tools. As class-\nrooms evolve into technologically advanced hubs of learning, understanding the\ndynamics that influence educators and students’ willingness to embrace MI be-\ncomes imperative. The study employs rigorous methodologies, including the\nUnified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, to navigate the interplay\nbetween factors such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social\ninfluence. By shedding light on the nuanced relationship between MI technol-\nogy and its users in education, their research aims to pave the way for informed\nstrategies that harness the full potential of MI in shaping the future of learning\nin Egypt. The work in [66] investigates the acceptance of applying chat-bot\ntechnology and related MI technologies, among higher education students in\nEgypt. Chat-bot, as an MI technology, has garnered significant attention, es-\npecially in the education sector. Before implementing such new technology, it\n18\n\nis vital to understand the determinants that affect students’ behavioral inten-\ntions to accept or reject this technology in higher education. To comprehend\nthis behavioral intention, the current research applied the Unified Theory of\nAcceptance and Use of Technology, excluding two moderators from the origi-\nnal model - experience and voluntariness of use. Additionally, their research\nwork excluded facilitating conditions and behavior use, focusing solely on the\nintention behavior of students. The research study also examined the role of de-\nmographic factors (gender and age) in influencing the independent variables of\nthe research model and the behavioral intention variable. The research outlined\nthe study’s objectives, including developing a framework for the acceptance of\nchat-bot technology on the behavioral intention of students in higher education\nin Egypt. To achieve these goals, the researcher collected data on the required\nvariables through a questionnaire targeting students at the Arab Academy for\nScience and Technology and Maritime Transport (AASTMT). AASTMT was\nchosen due to being one of the oldest private universities in Egypt that imple-\nments MI technology in its educational system. The final sample comprised 385\nresponses, and data analysis involved testing, descriptive analysis, correlations,\nregression, and structural equation modeling. Their Results indicated a signifi-\ncant impact of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence\non students’ behavioral intention to accept chat-bot technology in their higher\neducation in Egypt. Moreover, the results revealed no moderating role of de-\nmographic factors (gender and age) in the relationship between performance\nexpectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and behavioral intention. The\nstudy [67] explores the impact of MI on the tourism industry in Egypt. MI tools,\nsuch as chatbots and personalized service recommendations, play a significant\nrole in travel agencies, affecting various sectors within the tourism industry.\nThe research aims to investigate the implementation of MI techniques in Egyp-\ntian tourism companies and assess employees’ perceptions of using MI tools\nin tourism operations. Utilizing a quantitative approach, the researchers dis-\ntributed an online questionnaire to tourism companies, with 320 valid responses\nsubjected to statistical analysis. The results highlight notable differences among\ntourism companies offering full services when it comes to applying MI tools in\ntheir operations. Additionally, the size of tourism companies plays a role, with\nlarger and medium-scale enterprises employing MI techniques more than their\nsmaller counterparts. The study identifies two primary employee perspectives\non MI: enthusiasm for its advantages and suspicion regarding its disadvantages.\nFrom a managerial perspective, the research sheds light on applied MI tech-\nniques in tourism and underscores the importance of implementation.\nThis\ninsight can assist managers in formulating policies and strategies to enhance\ntechnological infrastructure, skills, and the application of beneficial MI tools,\nultimately improving performance and saving both time and money.\n2.2.2\nSmall Businesses\nIn the dynamic landscape of small and medium businesses in Egypt, NileCode\nemerges as a seasoned Technology House, boasting a remarkable 15-year journey\n19\n\nin crafting seamless digital experiences.

MI has the potential to drive progress, de-\nvelopment, and democratization if governments adeptly handle the challenges.\nIt can significantly enhance productivity growth by extending opportunities in\ncrucial African development sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, financial\nservices, and public services. MI holds the promise of enabling employees, en-\ntrepreneurs, and enterprises to compete globally and spearhead economic devel-\nopment by providing access to high-quality digital tools. However, addressing\nthe accompanying roadblocks requires decisive policy responses.\nThe imple-\nmentation of MI will necessitate significant adjustments for workers, employers,\nand businesses, opening new ethical questions that demand thoughtful answers.\nSpecific constraints in Africa, including network limitations, educational institu-\ntion readiness, and the availability of digital data, further compound the ethical\nissues. Aggressive efforts are essential for Africa to overcome these challenges,\nand success will position the continent to catch up with nations that have al-\nready taken strides in MI development. Although the path ahead is intricate,\nthe government’s effectiveness will be measured by its capacity to facilitate col-\nlaboration among all stakeholders, including state and civil society, academics,\nindustry, and national and international entities.\nThe work [73] introduces the topic of MI’s impact on the enjoyment of human\nrights and proposes initial considerations for a framework at the national level.\nThis paper primarily comprises a literature review on the subject, accompanied\nby concrete recommendations for overseeing MI in Morocco. It advocates for\nextensive consultations among stakeholders, aiming for co-regulation that cul-\nminates in the development of an ethical code. This code, guided by a human\nrights-based approach, is designed to address key principles, including Trans-\nparency & Trust, Equity, Safety, Human freedom & autonomy, Accountability\n25\n\n& Justice, Dignity & Integrity, Sustainability, and Solidarity & Inclusiveness.\nThe research presented in [74] centers on the development of a fully MI-\nbased system for automating water meter data collection in Morocco. As the\ndemand for water resources continues to rise, monitoring becomes crucial for\nthe rational and sustainable use of this vital resource. Currently, water meter\ndata collection in Morocco is predominantly performed manually once a month\ndue to cost and time constraints. This manual approach often leads to inaccu-\nrate estimations and calculations, resulting in customer disputes over inflated\ninvoices. The paper proposes a comprehensive MI-based system for automating\nwater meter data collection, comprising a Recognition System (RS) and a web\nservices platform. This framework offers a range of services for both customers\nand water service providers, including consumption monitoring, leak detection,\nvisualization of water consumption, and potable water coverage on a geographic\nmap. Additionally, it serves as a robust tool for facilitating accurate decision-\nmaking through multiple reporting services. The primary component of the RS\nis a Convolutional Neural Network model trained on a proposed MR-AMR (Mo-\nroccan Automatic Meter Reading) dataset, achieving an impressive accuracy of\n98.70% during the model test phase.\nThe system underwent thorough test-\ning and validation through experiments. The research outlined in [75] explores\nthe forecasting of regional tourism demand in Morocco, comparing traditional\nand MI-based methods to ensemble modeling. Tourism stands as a key eco-\nnomic contributor to Moroccan regions, accounting for 7.1% of the total GDP\nin 2019. However, this sector remains highly susceptible to external shocks such\nas political and social instability, currency fluctuations, natural disasters, and\npandemics.\nTo mitigate these challenges, policymakers employ various tech-\nniques to forecast tourism demand for informed decision-making. The study\nspecifically forecasts tourist arrivals to the Marrakech-Safi region using annual\ndata from 1999 to 2018. Three conventional approaches (ARIMA, AR, and lin-\near regression) are contrasted with three MI-based techniques (SVR, XGBoost,\nand LSTM). Hybrid models, combining both conventional and MI-based meth-\nods through ensemble learning, are then developed.\nThe results reveal that\nthese hybrid models outperform both conventional and MI-based techniques,\nshowcasing their ability to overcome individual method limitations.\n[76] examines Educational Sovereignty and challenges posed by MI in Mo-\nrocco. The study offers a concise and focused analysis of the primary threats\nto educational sovereignty in Morocco in the era of MI. It sheds light on the\nconcept of educational sovereignty within the Moroccan media and political\ndiscourse surrounding ”ministries of sovereignty.” The article outlines key ini-\ntiatives and projects in Morocco aimed at overcoming challenges to the educa-\ntional system and sovereignty in the age of MI, recognizing these systems as\nindispensable tools in learning and classroom practices. The study primarily\ndelves into the impacts of using foreign languages, the proliferation of foreign\nschools and transnational universities, the consequences of Moroccan educators\nand learners extensively employing foreign EdTech, and the influence of plat-\nforms and programs by major tech companies like GAFAM (Google, Apple,\nFacebook, Amazon, and Microsoft). It also addresses the threats arising from\n26\n\nthe absence of a national cloud computing structure, essential for safeguard-\ning digital sovereignty and protecting the personal data of learners and the\neducational system. The article contends that despite Morocco’s aspirations\nto establish a digital ecosystem capable of preserving educational sovereignty,\nnumerous subjective and objective obstacles still impede these plans.\nThe study presented in [77] employed factor analysis, a confirmatory method\ndesigned to identify latent factors from observable variables. This method in-\nvolves assigning a set of observable characteristics to each latent variable, and by\nsetting parameters (loadings) to 0 in confirmatory factor analysis, further analy-\nsis becomes possible, allowing correlations between latent factors and, if needed,\nadditional correlations between residual errors. This process offers a comprehen-\nsive description of hidden variables. The central question posed by the authors\nwas: To what extent does digitalization contribute to reducing inequalities in\ntechnological acceptance in Morocco?

Many countries, faces the\npressing challenge of combating GBV as an impediment towards ensuring the\nsafety and well-being of its citizens. Despite the coordinated efforts taken by\nseveral governments and its people, there remains a cause for concern regard-\ning curbing GBV globally. Women, children, and other vulnerable members of\nsociety continue to be exposed to this significant threat. Current measures are\nprimarily reactive, with focus on punishing perpetrators rather than foresee-\ning and preventing future occurrences. [234] provides a machine leaning-based\nanalytical process for predicting the occurrence of GBV to aid in early preven-\ntion strategies. A preliminary case study of the analytical process was recom-\nmended using Namibia as one of the South African countries. External dataset\nof GBV were extracted from kaggle platform containing some Namibia records\nfor preliminary study and model testing. It was recommended in this study\nthat Namibia should employ various machine learning algorithms as a test case.\nThese algorithms should be compared and evaluated for their predictive accu-\nracy in forecasting GBV events in Namibia. Additionally, the case study should\nconduct exploratory data analysis to identify key trends and drivers of GBV\nin Namibia, providing valuable insights for policymakers and intervention pro-\ngrams. By leveraging advanced ML techniques, the case study would contribute\nto evidence-based decision-making, policymaking, planning, and resource allo-\ncation aimed at reducing GBV incidents in Namibia. If the analytical process\nis duly followed and applied in Namibia, the research outcome would have the\npotentials to inform policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and social orga-\nnizations about the underlying causes and risk factors associated with GBV,\nenabling them to implement effective intervention strategies\nGlobally, Information Communication Technology device usage has seen a\nsteep rise over the last few years.\nThis also holds in developing countries,\nwhich have embarked on connecting the unconnected or previously disadvan-\ntaged parts of their populations. This connectivity enables people to interact\nwith cyberspace, which brings opportunities and challenges. Opportunities such\nas the ability to conduct business online, attend online education, and perform\nonline banking activities. Challenges experienced are the cost of Internet access\nand more worrying cyber-risks and potential for exploitation.\nThere remain\npockets of communities that experience sporadic connectivity to cyberspace,\nthese communities tend to be more susceptible to cyber-attacks due to issues\nof lack/limited awareness of cyber secure practices, an existent culture that\nmight be exploited by cybercriminals, and overall, a lackluster approach to their\ncyber-hygiene. The work in [235] presents a qualitative study conducted in rural\nNorthern Namibia. Our findings indicate that both secure and insecure cyberse-\n41\n\ncurity practices exist. However, through the Ubuntu and Uushiindaism Afrocen-\ntric lenses, practices such as sharing mobile devices without passwords among\nthe community mirror community unity. Practices such as this in mainstream\nresearch can be considered insecure. We also propose interrogating “common”\nsecure cybersecurity practices in their universality of applicability\nThe use of technology in ecology and conservation offers unprecedented op-\nportunities to survey and monitor wildlife remotely, for example by using camera\ntraps. However, such solutions typically cause challenges stemming from the big\ndatasets gathered, such as millions of camera trap images. MI is a proven, pow-\nerful tool to automate camera trap image analyses, but this is so far largely been\nrestricted to species identification from images. The work in [236] develops and\ntests an MI algorithm that allows discrimination of individual animals carrying\na tag (in this case a patagial yellow tag on vultures) from a large array of camera\ntrap images. Such a tool could assist scientists and practitioners using similar\npatagial tags on vultures, condors and other large birds worldwide. We show\nthat the overall performance of such an algorithm is relatively good, with 88.9%\nof all testing images (i.e. those not used for training or validation) correctly\nclassified using a cut-off discrimination of 0.4. Specifically, performance was\nhigh for correctly classifying images with a tag (95.2% of all positive images\ncorrectly classified), but less so for images without a tag (87.0% of all negative\nimages). The correct classification of images with a tag was, however, signif-\nicantly higher when the tag code was at least partly readable compared with\nthe other cases. Overall, this study underscores the potential of MI for assisting\nscientists and practitioners in analysing big datasets from camera traps.\nFarmers in Namibia currently operate their irrigation systems manually, and\nthis seems to increase labor and regular attention, especially for large farms.\nWith technological advancements, the use of automated irrigation could allow\nfarmers to manage irrigation based on a certain crops’ water requirements.

Their study aimed to assess the effectiveness\nof four machine learning methods (Random Forest (RF), Maximum Entropy\n(MaxEnt), Artificial Neural Network, and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT)) in\nidentifying gully-driving factors and predicting gully erosion susceptibility in\nthe Luzinzi watershed, Walungu territory, eastern Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. Gullies were initially identified through field surveys and digitized using\na high-resolution image from Google Earth. Of the 270 identified gullies, 70%\n(189) were randomly selected for training the machine learning methods with\ntopographical, hydrological, and environmental factors. The remaining 30% (81\ngullies) were used for testing the methods.\nThey have used the area under\nthe receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) method. Results showed that\nRF and MaxEnt algorithms outperformed other methods, with RF (AUROC\n= 0.82) and MaxEnt (AUROC = 0.804) exhibiting higher prediction accuracies\nthan BRT (AUROC = 0.69) and ANN (AUROC = 0.55). TSS results indicated\nthat RF and MaxEnt were the best methods in predicting gully susceptibility in\nLuzinzi watershed. Factors like Digital Elevation Model, Normalized Difference\nWater Index, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, slope, distance to roads,\ndistance to rivers, and Stream Power Index played key roles in gully occurrence.\nConsidering these factors is crucial for policymakers to develop strategies to\nreduce the risk of gully occurrence and related consequences at the watershed\nscale in eastern DRC.\nDeveloping countries often face financial constraints in providing public\ngoods. Property taxation is seen as a promising local revenue source due to\nits efficiency, ability to capture real estate value growth, and potential for pro-\ngressivity. However, ineffective property tax collection is common in many low-\nincome countries, often due to missing or incomplete property tax rolls. In a\nlarge Congolese city, the work in [107] employs machine learning and computer\nvision models to build a property tax roll. Training the algorithm on 1,654 ran-\ndomly selected properties assessed during government land surveyors’ in-person\nvisits, along with property characteristics from administrative data or extracted\nfrom photographs, we achieve promising results. The best machine learning al-\ngorithm, trained on administrative data, achieves a cross-validated R2 of 60%,\nwith 22% of predicted values within 20% of the target value. Computer vision\n59\n\nalgorithms, relying on property picture features, perform less effectively, with\nonly 9% of predicted values within 20% of the target value for the best algorithm.\nThese findings suggest that even in contexts with limited property information,\nsimple machine learning methods can assist in constructing a property tax roll,\nparticularly when the government can only collect a small number of property\nvalues through in-person visits.\n4.5.2\nSmall Businesses\nIn North Kivu, a province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, many\npeople earn their livelihood as small-scale farmers.

The rising\nsea level due to climate change poses a critical threat, particularly affecting vul-\nnerable low-lying coastal areas such as the Gulf of Guinea (GoG). This impact\nnecessitates precise sea level prediction models to guide planning and mitiga-\ntion efforts for safeguarding coastal communities and ecosystems. The study\npresents a comprehensive analysis of mean sea level anomaly (MSLA) trends in\nthe GoG between 1993 and 2020, covering three distinct periods (1993–2002,\n2003–2012, and 2013–2020).\nIt investigates connections between interannual\nsea level variability and large-scale oceanic and atmospheric forcings.\nAddi-\ntionally, the performance of artificial neural networks (LSTM and MLPR) and\nother machine learning techniques (MLR, GBM, and RFR) is evaluated to opti-\nmize sea level predictions. The findings reveal a consistent rise in MSLA linear\ntrends across the basin, particularly pronounced in the north, with a total linear\ntrend of 88 mm/year over the entire period. The highest decadal trend (38.7\nmm/year) emerged during 2013–2020, and the most substantial percentage in-\ncrement (100%) occurred in 2003–2012. Spatial variation in decadal sea-level\ntrends was influenced by subbasin physical forcings. Strong interannual signals\nin the spatial sea level distribution were identified, linked to large-scale oceanic\nand atmospheric phenomena.\nSeasonal variations in sea level trends are at-\ntributed to seasonal changes in the forcing factors. Model evaluation indicates\nRFR and GBR as accurate methods, reproducing interannual sea level patterns\nwith 97% and 96% accuracy, respectively. These findings contribute essential\ninsights for effective coastal management and climate adaptation strategies in\n61\n\nthe GoG. [109] explores the spatial ecology and conservation of leatherback tur-\ntles (Dermochelys coriacea) nesting in Bioko, Equatorial Guinea. Bioko Island\n(Equatorial Guinea) hosts essential nesting habitat for leatherback sea turtles,\nwith the main nesting beaches found on the island’s southern end. Nest moni-\ntoring and protection have been ongoing for more than two decades, although\ndistribution and habitat range at sea remain to be determined. This study uses\nsatellite telemetry to describe the movements of female leatherback turtles (n\n= 10) during and following the breeding season, tracking them to presumed off-\nshore foraging habitats in the south Atlantic Ocean. Leatherback turtles spent\n100% of their time during the breeding period within the Exclusive Economic\nZone of Equatorial Guinea, with a core distribution focused on the south of\nBioko Island extending up to 10 km from the coast. During this period, turtles\nspent less than 10% of time within the existing protected area. Extending the\nborder of this area by 3 km offshore would lead to a greater than threefold\nincrease in coverage of turtle distribution (29.8 ± 19.0% of time), while an ex-\npansion to 15 km offshore would provide spatial coverage for more than 50% of\ntracking time. Post-nesting movements traversed the territorial waters of Sao\nTom´e and Principe (6.4% of tracking time), Brazil (0.85%), Ascension (1.8%),\nand Saint Helena (0.75%). The majority (70%) of tracking time was spent in\nareas beyond national jurisdiction (i.e. the High Seas). This study reveals that\nconservation benefits could be achieved by expanding existing protected areas\nstretching from the Bioko coastal zone, and suggests shared migratory routes\nand foraging space between the Bioko population and other leatherback turtle\nrookeries in this region.\n[110] explores knowledge about Fang Traditional Medicine:\nan informal\nhealth-seeking behavior for medical or cultural afflictions in Equatorial Guinea.\nThis study delves into a range of informal health-seeking behaviors, including\nthe use of Fang Traditional Medicine (FTM) for medical or cultural afflictions in\nEquatorial Guinea (EQ). The research covers therapeutic methods, health prob-\nlems addressed, the learning process, traditional medicine user profiles, and the\nsocial images of Fang Traditional Healers (FTHs). Ethnography was employed\nas a qualitative strategy using emic-etic approaches. Semi-structured interviews\nwere conducted with 45 individuals, including 6 community leaders, 19 tribal\nelders, 7 healthcare professionals, 11 FTHs, and 2 relatives of traditional healers\nin 5 districts of EQ. FTM offers a cure for malaria and treatments for reproduc-\ntive health issues, bone fractures, and cultural illnesses. Several methods used to\nlearn FTM are based on empirical observation, without the need for traditional\nschooling.\nFor example, watching a family member or the spirits/ancestors\ncan reveal healing knowledge. Materials from forests, including tree barks and\nplants, and rituals are used to keep Fang populations healthy. In addition, two\nrituals known as ’osuin’ and ’etoak’ (infusions of tree barks with the blood of\nsacrificed animals) are the most commonly used treatments. Elders and women\nare the most active consumers of FTM, playing a relevant role in curing med-\nical and cultural afflictions in Fang communities. The informal health-seeking\nbehavior among the Fang community is conditioned by the explanation model\nof illness.\n62\n\n4.6.2\nGovernment\nEquatorial Guinea’s economic landscape, predominantly reliant on the oil and\ngas sector, presents a vulnerability due to its susceptibility to fluctuating global\nprices and the finite nature of these resources.\nEmbracing MI technologies\noffers a strategic avenue for economic diversification.

We propose an integrated method\nof pixel-based classification using Landsat 8 data, the Random Forest classifier,\nand ancillary data to produce high-quality land cover products for a broad range\nof applications, including natural capital accounting. Our approach focuses on\na pre-classification filtering (Masking Phase) based on spectral signature and\nancillary data to reduce the number of pixels prone to be misclassified, thereby\nincreasing the quality of the final product. The proposed approach yields an\noverall accuracy of 83% and 81% for Liberia and Gabon, respectively, outper-\nforming prior land cover products for these countries in both thematic content\nand accuracy. Their approach is replicable and was able to produce high-quality\nland cover products to fill an observational gap in up-to-date land cover data\nat the national scale for Liberia and Gabon. [112] studies the Grand Libre-\nville, Gabon coastline using machine learning and convolutional neural network\ndetection and automatic extraction methods. Coastal erosion, worsened by cli-\nmate change and natural occurrences like droughts and marine flooding, is a\nmajor problem. Countries situated along coastlines face significant challenges\nin preserving their land and protecting their people and assets. To mitigate\n63\n\nthe damage caused by sea encroachment on land, effective monitoring tools\nand methods are required. This study uses Object-oriented Analysis (OBIA),\nPixel-Oriented Analysis (PBIA), and Convolutional Neural Network methods\nto automatically detect and extract the Greater Libreville coastline based on\nPl´eiades very high-resolution satellite images dating from 2022. Three test areas\nwere chosen and extracted, showing competitive Overall Accuracy values with\nthe OBIA method and the CNN model. However, the OBIA method using the\nRandom Forest algorithm achieved the highest accuracy rates, reaching 95%,\n90%, and 80% for the three test areas, respectively. [113] utilizes a deep learn-\ning framework for the estimation of forest height from bistatic TanDEM-X data.\nUp-to-date canopy height model estimates are crucial for forest resource moni-\ntoring and disturbance analysis. This study presents a deep learning approach\nfor the regression of forest height from TanDEM-X bistatic interferometric syn-\nthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. The proposed fully convolutional neural\nnetwork framework is trained using reference CHM measurements derived from\nthe LiDAR LVIS airborne sensor from NASA, acquired during the joint NASA-\nESA 2016 AfriSAR campaign over five sites in Gabon, Africa. The DL model\nachieves an overall performance of 1.46-m mean error, 4.2-m mean absolute\nerror, and 15.06% mean absolute percentage error when tested on all consid-\nered sites. Additionally, a spatial transfer analysis provides insights into the\ngeneralization capability of the network when trained and tested on datasets\nacquired over different locations and types of tropical vegetation. The results\nare promising and align with state-of-the-art methods based on both physical-\nbased modeling and data-driven approaches, with the advantage of requiring\nonly one single TanDEM-X acquisition at inference time.\n4.7.2\nIndustry\nNeural networks have been used in the oil and gas industry in [115, 116, 117,\n118, 119, 120].\n4.8\nRepublic of the Congo\nCongo\n2020-2023\nConcrete Actions\nResearch\n✓\nSMB\n✓\nInformal\nEconomy\n✓\nGovernment ✓\nAfrican Research Cen-\ntre on artificial intelli-\ngence\nTable 20: MI in Congo\n64\n\n4.8.1\nGovernment\nOn February 24, 2022, the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the\nGovernment of the Republic of Congo inaugurated a groundbreaking center de-\nvoted exclusively to advancing research through MI, aiming to propel digital\ntechnology in Africa across areas such as digital policy, infrastructure, finance,\nskills, digital platforms, and entrepreneurship. The African Research Centre on\nartificial intelligence, funded through the ECA and other partners, will provide\nthe necessary technology education and skills to promote Africa’s integration,\ncontributing to generating inclusive economic growth, stimulating job creation,\nbreaking the digital divide, and eradicating poverty for the continent’s socio-\neconomic development, ensuring Africa’s ownership of modern tools of digital\nmanagement.

Social safety net programs often tar-\nget the poorest and most vulnerable populations. However, in many developing\ncountries, there is a lack of administrative data on the relative wealth of the\npopulation to support the selection process for potential beneficiaries of these\nprograms. Therefore, the selection process often involves a multi-methodological\napproach, starting with geographical targeting for the selection of program im-\nplementation areas.\nTo facilitate this stage of the targeting process in Sao Tom´e and Principe,\ntheir article develops High-Resolution Satellite Imagery (HRSI) poverty maps,\nproviding estimates of poverty incidence and program eligibility at a highly\ndetailed resolution (110 m x 110 m). The analysis combines poverty incidence\nand population density to facilitate the geographical targeting process.\nTheir work demonstrates that HRSI poverty maps can serve as key oper-\national tools to aid decision-making in geographical targeting and efficiently\nidentify entry points for rapidly expanding social safety net programs. Unlike\nHRSI poverty maps based on census data, poverty maps based on satellite data\nand machine learning can be updated frequently at a low cost, supporting more\nadaptive social protection programs. [122] examines the role of value chains\nanalysis in the agricultural sector, focusing on the case of pepper value chains\nin Sao Tom´e e Principe. Despite significant progress in yield and productive\ncapacity, global inequality persists, with hundreds of millions suffering from\nhunger and undernourishment.\nClimate change poses a significant threat to\nagriculture, emphasizing the need for sustainable agricultural value chains that\npromote and protect natural resources while being inclusive and supportive of\n66\n\nsmallholders. Value chain analysis, often used in policy development by NGOs,\ninternational organizations, and governments, plays a crucial role in promoting\neconomic progress for less favored smallholders in the global market. In Sao\nTom´e and Principe, where conditions such as dimension, insularity, and poverty\nare specific, the promotion of value chains is particularly dependent on foreign\naid. The case of the pepper value chain reveals similarities between formal and\ninformal producers in terms of production systems, but the formal sector tends\nto be more stable and financially protected than the informal sector.\n5\nWestern Africa\nWestern Africa has a total area of 5,112,903 squared kilometers, with a pop-\nulation of 418,544,337.

The book ex-\namines potential errors of these conversational agents and the need to\ncorrect them to ensure better interaction with African users.\n• Question 4: The book also tackles intriguing questions about delusions,\nillusions, confabulations, and hallucinations in generative machine intelli-\ngence. Do these phenomena actually exist or are they just analogies?\n• Question 5: Machine intelligence also finds applications in the financial\nsector in Africa. The book explores opportunities and challenges related\nto using machine intelligence for banking without traditional banks in the\ninformal sector.\n• Question 6: In the agricultural sector, can machine intelligence be consid-\nered a delusion or an opportunity for Africa? This book guides us through\na thorough reflection on the use of machine intelligence in African agri-\nculture, examining potential advantages such as cost reduction and opti-\nmization of agricultural practices.\n• Question 7: Manure is becoming increasingly interesting for mass agricul-\nture in Africa. This book invites you to explore this alternative with ma-\nchine intelligence from plants and animal waste, particularly cattle urine.\n• Question 8: In the livestock sector, can machine intelligence be an ally in\nherd monitoring and improving animal welfare? This book encourages us\nto ponder the effects of machine intelligence in livestock.\n• Question 9: A crucial question arises: can the use of machine intelligence\ncontribute to reducing the cost of animal feed in Africa? The authors\nof this book explore the possibilities offered by machine intelligence to\noptimize animal feeding processes, highlighting the economic and envi-\nronmental implications of this approach. What is the optimal strategy\nbetween producing livestock feed oneself, arranging with local producers,\nand buying imported concentrates from other continents?\n• Question 10: The book also raises questions about access to machine\nintelligence in African contexts where internet access may be limited. How\ncan the integration of machine intelligence be envisioned in environments\nwhere connectivity is a major challenge?\n• Question 11: Another essential question addressed in this book concerns\nempowering women through machine intelligence. This book urges us to\nreflect on the socio-economic implications of this technology, evaluating\nwhether its adoption can strengthen or, conversely, amplify existing in-\nequalities.\n80\n\n• Question 12: The book also examines the risks of inequalities and stereo-\ntypes arising from the massive use of machine intelligence. How can we\nensure that machine intelligence systems do not reproduce biases and dis-\ncriminations present in African society? This book pushes us to question\npractices and responsibilities related to machine intelligence in the fight\nagainst inequalities and stereotypes.\n• Question 13: The spread of misinformation is a major challenge in the\ndigital world. The book explores the possibility that machine intelligence\nmay accentuate this phenomenon and highlights measures to mitigate this\nrisk in Africa.\n• Question 14: In the fight against crime, can machine intelligence be an\neffective tool, or does it represent a double-edged sword? The book invites\nus to reflect on the implications for security, confidentiality, and human\nrights in using machine intelligence to combat crime.\n• Question 15: How can machine intelligence contribute to civil protection\nin Africa? The book examines the potential applications of this technology\nin disaster prevention, crisis management, and improving the resilience of\nAfrican communities.\n• Question 16: The health sector is also explored in the book. How can\nmachine intelligence be used to improve healthcare in Africa? This book\nraises crucial questions about potential illegal practices and ethical issues\nrelated to the use of machine intelligence in the healthcare field.\n• Question 17: Can the massive integration of machine intelligence pose\nenergy supply problems in certain African countries? This book leads us\nto reflect on the implications of this technology on electricity demand and\nto identify sustainable solutions to address this challenge.\n• Question 18: In the field of road safety, can the widespread use of machine\nintelligence lead to greater inattention, distraction, and insecurity? The\nbook raises important questions about the potential consequences of inte-\ngrating machine intelligence into vehicles and the need to ensure increased\nsafety on African roads.\n• Question 19: The nineteenth question in this book discusses the potential\noffered by intelligence for auditing, but its reliability depends on several\nfactors, including the quality of data, the accuracy of algorithms, and the\nability to adapt to changes.\n• Question 20: The integration of machine intelligence into education sparks\nmany discussions about the role of machines in teaching and learning. This\ntwentieth and final question, far from the least, explores the question of\nwho should be responsible for the use of machine intelligence in education\nand what the proposed content will be. The use of machine intelligence\nin education can have several advantages, such as personalized learning,\n81\n\nproviding instant feedback to students, and access to online learning re-\nsources. However, it is important to consider who will be responsible for\ndesigning and implementing these technologies.\nMost languages of the world are predominantly oral, with little to no writing\ntradition. In recent years, the African continent was completely missing on the\nNLP map, but due to efforts of grassroots communities such as Masakhane,\nAfrica is now present on the NLP map focused on African languages. Despite\nall the efforts made thus far, more progress is needed. As of August 2023, Mali’s\npopulation stands at approximately 22 million individuals. The country boasts\n13 national languages and an illiteracy rate of 65%. Interestingly, 80% of the\npopulation communicates in Bambara. In the past, French held the position of\nthe official language; however, merely 35% of the people were adept in functional\nliteracy in French. Notably, Mali has recently embraced a new constitution that\nrelegates French from its former status while elevating all 13 national languages\nto the rank of official languages.\nDONIYA-SO a legal non-governmental platform on Data Science and MI\nin Bamako, Mali is studying B.A.M.B.A.R.A: Breaking Audio Multilingual\nBarriers Advancing Research Across Africa.\nThe MI project aims to build\nhigh-quality audio/sound/speech datasets for Predominantly Oral Languages\n(POLs). The work seeks to narrow this language gap by gathering top-notch\naudio/sound/speech datasets for Bambara. This effort will not only facilitate\nresearch outcomes for the remaining 12 languages of Mali but also extend its\nbenefits beyond. The state-of-the-art machine learning including deep learning\nmodels requires a significant amount of data, which is not readily available in\nlow-resource settings, and this is the case for POLs. If funded, this project has\nthe potential to increase the amount of data usable by researchers, and develop-\ners in the field of ML. This, when successfully implemented, has the potential\nto increase literacy rate, open our people to the world, and the world to our\npeople.\nThe work in [404] focuses on preprocessing approaches in machine-learning-\nbased groundwater potential mapping in Mali, specifically the Koulikoro and\nBamako regions.

Startups and tech companies are developing innovative\nsolutions to address challenges faced by farmers. For instance, Timadie is an in-\nnovative platform of platforms that is based on graphchain technologies adapted\nfor less connected environments.\nIn the agriculture sector, the Guinaga platform has physically engaged with\nover 400 farmers and is developing a graphchain as a traceability tool for food\nproducts. Graphchains such as MangueChain, Karit´eton, Yuton, and Rizton\nhave contributed to the valorization of local products in Senegal, Mali, and\nBurkina Faso. It utilizes MI, Blockchain, and Graphchain technologies to opti-\nmize the supply chain, air pollution, and understand production, consumption,\nsales, purchases, transportation, storage, and more in Mali, Burkina Faso, and\nSenegal. The data contributes to building a Kariteton, incorporating shea but-\nter production. MI techniques aid in estimating production 8 weeks in advance\nto reduce demand-supply mismatch. Guinaga also employs deep learning in its\nManguechain for tracking mangoes from tree to consumer tables. Guinaga’s\nknitting and crochet club is a dedicated platform for cotton and indigo plant\ncultivation for natural dyes, semi-automatic machine knitting, providing a space\nfor knowledge sharing, creativity, and support for knitting enthusiasts.\nSince 2019, SK1 Sogoloton uses deep learning for videos analytics for infor-\nmation dissemination in 25 languages across Africa. Users can access reliable\nand verifiable information, participate in information production, and combat\nmisinformation in Africa. The platform has over 10 million video views and 200\nmillion interactions as of November 2023. CI4SI, from the learning and game\ntheory laboratory, emphasizes collective intelligence and encourages collabora-\ntion to solve societal problems.\nThe Grabal platform is a catalyst for connecting traditional livestock breed-\ners in Africa, promoting the preservation of genetic diversity. MoutonChain,\nin particular, has ensured the traceability of sheep, providing consumers with\nthe necessary confidence during the Tabaski period from 2019 to 2023. Grabal\nlinks breeders directly to buyers from the field, utilizing MI-enabled drones to\nestimate animal food, headcount, and safe paths in Mali, Burkina Faso, and\nSenegal.\nWETE has opened new perspectives for the economic empowerment of\nwomen in Africa. To date, 150 African women CEOs are present on the platform.\nWomen-in-Drones promotes the participation of women in emerging sectors such\nas drone technology and dronegraphy. To date, 23 women have been trained in\n83\n\ndrone piloting and the uses of MI in video-processing in Mali. The particularity\nhere is that these trained women uses MI-enabled drones in their professional\nworks such as mineral extraction, geo-information, and crisis management.\nBy fostering interconnectivity and encouraging co-opetition, Timadie pro-\nvides an environment conducive to the emergence of new ideas, fruitful collab-\norations, and significant social innovations in multiple African countries.\nTimadie, hosting various platforms, has trained students at several schools\non MI applications in geo-information systems, economy, transportation, energy,\nhealthcare, and agriculture.\n5.10.3\nArt & Music\nSK1’ART tests the accuracy and reliability of several music and Dogon mask\ngenerated by MI.

Colonel Assimi Goita, leading the tran-\nsitional government, initiated the construction of the Center for Artificial In-\ntelligence and Robotics (CIAR-Mali) in Kati, Koulikoro region in Mali. This\nvisionary project, designated as a Public Scientific, Technical, and Cultural Es-\ntablishment, is set to become a hub for cutting-edge research, development, and\neducational activities in artificial intelligence and robotics. With an estimated\nconstruction cost of 3.3 billion F CFA (4.5 million euros), the CIAR-Mali un-\nderscores the government’s firm belief in the transformative power of artificial\nintelligence. This strategic investment not only signifies a commitment to tech-\nnological advancement but also presents an unparalleled opportunity for the\nyouth of Mali and Africa. Aspiring individuals keen on contributing to the con-\ntinent’s technological evolution now have a potential avenue through the CIAR-\nMali. Fast forward to October 19, 2023, the ratification bill for the creation of\nthe CIAR-Mali received the unanimous approval of the National Transitional\nCouncil. This legislative approval solidified the center’s role in fostering inno-\nvation and knowledge transfer within the domains of artificial intelligence and\nrobotics. However, despite the legislative green light, the center has not yet\ncommenced its operational phase as of the current date. The CIAR-Mali un-\nderscores the nation’s forward-looking approach, emphasizing the pivotal role\nthat artificial intelligence and robotics play in shaping the future of Mali and\ncontributing to the broader technological landscape of the African continent.\n5.11\nMauritania\n5.11.1\nResearch\nThe work in [400] explores MI-driven insights into the factors influencing stu-\ndents’ choice of English studies as a major at the University of Nouakchott\n84\n\nAl Aasriya, Mauritania.

Its popularity is growing glob-\nally, with an increasing number of players in the entertainment industry trying\nto get a slice of it. When machine intelligence apps began spreading in Nigeria’s\nmusic industry, Eclipse Nkasi thought his days as a producer were numbered.\nHowever, he took a step back, identified opportunities as well as threats, and\nused the technology to generate a whole new Afrobeats album in his studio on\nthe outskirts of Lagos. MI doesn’t have to replace what we have. It gives people\na new experience... and that’s how I believe MI is really going to shake things.\nIn the past, it would have taken him thousands of dollars and up to three months\nto compose the tracks, recruit musicians, record performances, refine them in\na traditional studio, and release them to fans. Nigerian artists activated MI\nalgorithms and set them to work, assisting in creating the nine-track album\n”Infinite Echoes.” They instructed it to auto-generate song lyrics and titles,\nincluding ”God Whispers,” ”Love Tempo,” and ”Dream Chaser.” Then, they\nmodified the words themselves to fit their chosen theme - a struggling artist\nnot giving up on their passion for creating music. Next, they used another MI\ntool to generate the tunes. Nkasi recorded some vocals and fed them into yet\nanother app, transforming his vocals into the voice of the album’s generated\nsinger - a virtual ”singer” named Mya Blue, who appears online as a computer\nanimation in front of her audience. Certain things may become obsolete due\nto MI, but it should also create opportunities for artists to reinvent themselves\nand improve their work more efficiently. The technology is already transforming\nthe industry and could have a positive impact on production values and other\ntechnical aspects of the recording process. However, there are still uncertainties\nand areas, including copyright, that need consideration and development.\nInitially launched in February 2023 in the US and Canada, followed by the\nUK and Ireland in May, DJ is a personalized MI guide that offers users a care-\nfully curated lineup of music, accompanied by commentary on the tracks and\nartists, all delivered in a realistic voice. The feature aims to foster a stronger\nconnection between users and their music, enabling discovery through tailored\nrecommendations. The initial voice model for DJ was based on Spotify’s Head\nof Cultural Partnerships, Xavier ’X’ Jernigan. However, the latest rollout ex-\ntends the offering to include commentary in English for listeners in various\ninternational markets. African countries where the DJ feature is now accessi-\nble include Botswana, Burundi, eSwatini, the Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho,\nLiberia, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tan-\nzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Never before has listening felt so com-\npletely personal to each and every user, thanks to the powerful combination of\nSpotify’s personalization technology, generative AI, and a dynamic, expressive\nvoice. Users can access the AI DJ by opening the Spotify mobile app on their\niOS or Android devices.\nAfter launching the app, they can navigate to the\nMusic Feed on the homepage and tap play on the DJ feature.\n88\n\n5.13.4\nGovernment\nThe National Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (NCAIR) is one of\nNITDA’s special purpose vehicles created to promote research and development\non emerging technologies and their practical application in areas of Nigerian\nnational interest.

In 2023, Nigeria is extending an invi-\ntation to scientists of Nigerian heritage, as well as globally renowned experts\nwho have worked within the Nigerian market, to collaborate in the formula-\ntion of its National Artificial Intelligence Strategy. According to the Minister\nof Communications, Innovation and Digital Economy, the National Information\nTechnology Development Agency has initiated the development of a National\nMI Strategy. The action will impact the way the government formulates new\ntechnological solutions for its critical national challenges. As a result, the gov-\nernment is broadening its co-creation strategy by assembling a selection of lead-\ning MI researchers with Nigerian heritage from around the world. The Nigerian\ngovernment recognizes that MI has developed into a versatile technology, re-\nshaping production and services and holds immense potential for influencing\nsocietal progress and economic expansion. According to a white paper titled\nCo-creating a National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Nigeria, a sophisti-\ncated method was used to pinpoint accomplished MI researchers with Nigerian\nroots, using global MI publication data and advanced machine learning models.\nResearch index was created to locate influential machine intelligence researchers\nof Nigerian heritage. As the preliminary research phase concludes, the Nigerian\ngovernment seeks public involvement, acknowledging the potential for errors\nand aiming to tap into collective knowledge and insights. The government of\nNigeria via the National Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics aims to\nestablish communities of MI developers nationwide to influence the country’s\ntechnological future.

The work in [297] built machine-learning based mod-\nels to estimates malaria cases in Burundi. The forecast of malaria cases was\ncarried out at province level and national scale as well. Long short term mem-\nory model, a type of deep learning model has been used to achieve best results\nusing climate-change related factors such as temperature, rainfall, and relative\nhumidity, together with malaria historical data and human population. With\nthis model, the results showed that at country level different tuning of param-\neters can be used in order to determine the minimum and maximum expected\nmalaria cases. The univariate version of that model which learns from previous\ndynamics of malaria cases give more precise estimates at province-level, but\nboth models have same trends overall at province-level and country-level.\nBananas are the dominant crop in Burundi.

It is an important\nparameter for the weather files used by energy building simulation software for\ncalculating the longwave radiation heat exchange between the exterior surface\n98\n\nand the sky. In the literature, there are several models to estimate sky tempera-\nture. However, these models have not been completely satisfactory as far as the\nhot and humid climate is concerned. In this case, the sky temperature remains\noverestimated. The work in [301] is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the\nsky temperature measurement conducted, for the first time in Djibouti, with\na pyrgeometer, a tool designed to measure longwave radiation as a component\nof thermal radiation, and an artificial neural network model for improved sky\ntemperature forecasting.A systematic comparison of known correlations for sky\ntemperature estimation under various climatic conditions revealed their limited\naccuracy in the region, as indicated by low R2 values and high root mean square\nerrors (RMSEs). To address these limitations, we introduced an ANN model,\ntrained, validated and tested on the collected data, to capture complex patterns\nand relationships in the data.

Logistic regression (Pegasos) produced correct\nclassifications for 81.14% (83.44%) of the years tested. The variable weights\nsuggest that El Ni˜no plays an important role but, since the region has under-\ngone a steady warming trend of 1.6 Celsius since the 1950s, the larger weights\nassociated with positive temperature anomalies are critical for correct classifi-\ncation.\nThe work [305] develops an Interpretable machine learning for predicting\nevaporation from Awash reservoirs in Ethiopia.

They focused on one specific\nplant, strawberry guava, and used pictures from satellites that anyone can access\nto learn more about how these plants affect tropical forests.\nThis might be\nthe first time someone used these free satellite pictures to create a map of\nstrawberry guava and the first time they used this method to map invasive\nspecies in Mauritius.\nIn a park in Mauritius called Black River Gorges National Park (BRGNP),\nthe researchers did some on-the-ground observations and collected 4670 samples\nto understand how much strawberry guava covered different areas. They used\n70% of this information to teach their computer models and make them better,\nand the other 30% they kept to test how accurate their models were. They used\nspecial satellite images and a tool called Google Earth Engine for this. They\nalso used some calculations to help them understand the colors and textures of\nthe strawberry guava plants in the pictures.\nTheir computer models, called Random Forest and Support Vector Machine,\ndid a really good job. RF was recommended for future studies because it was\n109\n\nvery accurate (97.60% ± 0.20% with 95% confidence) and made predictions\nin more consistent areas.\nThey also found that strawberry guava was most\ncommon in the central parts of BRGNP and on steeper slopes. Surprisingly, the\namount of strawberry guava didn’t change much from 2016 to 2020.\nIn [211], the authors explore new ways, like using computers to analyze lots\nof data, to predict how bad accidents might be.\nThey tried different computer methods, like Support Vector Machine, Gra-\ndient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, all using\na programming language called Python. The method called Gradient Boosting\ndid the best job in figuring out how severe accidents could be. It was right\nabout 83.2% of the time, which is pretty good, and it had an AUC of 83.9%,\nshowing it’s effective in making these predictions.\n[212] examines proper identification of plant species has major benefits for\na wide range of stakeholders ranging from forestry services, botanists, tax-\nonomists, physicians, pharmaceutical laboratories, organisations fighting for en-\ndangered species, government and the public at large. Consequently, this has\nfueled an interest in developing automated systems for the recognition of differ-\nent plant species. A fully automated method for the recognition of medicinal\nplants using computer vision and machine learning techniques has been pre-\nsented.\nLeaves from 24 different medicinal plant species were collected and\nphotographed using a smartphone in a laboratory setting. A large number of\nfeatures were extracted from each leaf such as its length, width, perimeter, area,\nnumber of vertices, colour, perimeter and area of hull. Several derived features\nwere then computed from these attributes. The best results were obtained from\na random forest classifier using a 10-fold crossvalidation technique. With an\naccuracy of 90.1%, the random forest classifier performed better than other ma-\nchine learning approaches such as the k-nearest neighbour, naive Bayes, support\nvector machines and neural networks. These results are very encouraging and\nfuture work will be geared towards using a larger dataset and high-performance\ncomputing facilities to investigate the performance of deep learning neural net-\nworks to identify medicinal plants used in primary health care. To the best\nof our knowledge, this work is the first of its kind to have created a unique\nimage dataset for medicinal plants that are available on the island of Mauri-\ntius.\nIt is anticipated that a web-based or mobile computer system for the\nautomatic recognition of medicinal plants will help the local population to im-\nprove their knowledge on medicinal plants, help taxonomists to develop more\nefficient species identification techniques and will also contribute significantly in\nthe protection of endangered species.\nThe research work [213] studies flood prediction using Machine neural net-\nworks in Mauritius. The average temperature of the earth is increasing at an\nalarming rate and it has been envisaged to increase by a factor of about 1.4 to\n5.8 degree Celsius by the year 2100. An increase in the atmospheric tempera-\nture entails the occurrence of many extreme events such as stronger heat waves,\nformation of intense cyclones, unprecedented flash floods and severe drought\nevents which are set to impact greatly on both the global economy and society.\nAmong the various natural disasters, which affect mankind, flash floods have\n110\n\nbeen reported to cause more casualties in terms of economic loss, death tolls and\ninfrastructural damages. Flooding has become a recurrent phenomenon in the\nrecent decade accounting for about 73% of damages caused by natural disasters\nwhich in turn results in an overall loss of about $30 billions. Flash floods are\nthus a global phenomenon affecting major parts of the world as indicated for the\nyear 2018, which marked the occurrence of several deadly flash floods in Kerala,\nFrance and Vietnam. In [213] the focus is on Mauritius, which is a small island\nlocated in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa and Madagascar. The\nmorphological landscape of Mauritius consists of highlands and coastal regions\nin a relatively small geographical area of 1865 km² such that it is typical for the\nisland to experience several microclimates on the same day in different regions.\nTheir study is especially motivated by the occurrence of a series of flash floods\nin Mauritius.\nReceiving and managing complaints effectively are important for organisa-\ntions which aim to provide excellent customer service.\nIn order for this to\nhappen, organisations should make it quick and easy for users to report issues.\nIn [214] , a smart mobile application for complaints management in Mauritius\nis described.\nUsers of this mobile application can report issues for different\norganisations using a single application on their smartphones. They can reg-\nister complaints using text, images or videos, and they do not have to specify\nwhich authority the complaint is directed to. Instead, the application uses text\nand image analysis alongside a Convolutional Neural Network in order to di-\nrect complaints to the correct utility organisations. The classifiers have been\ntrained to identify different categories of complaints for each local utility organ-\nisation. Users are notified regarding the status of their complaints and can use\nthe application to directly communicate with the personnel.\nSmall Island Developing States (SIDS), like Mauritius, share similar sus-\ntainable development challenges inherent to their characteristics.\nGrowth in\nthe global energy demand and fears of energy supply disruptions, have trig-\ngered much debate geared towards the necessity for sustainable energy plan-\nning. Accurate forecasting of future electricity demand is an essential input to\nthis process. Such forecasts are also important in regional or national power\nsystem strategy Management. Non linearity of the factors adds complexity to\nthe electricity load forecasting process. Statistical learning theory, in the form\nof Support Vector Machines, have been used successfully to tackle nonlinear\nregression and time series problems. However application to the electricity de-\nmand forecasting problem with focus on SIDS’characteristics is lacking. The\narticle [215] focuses on the application of SVMs to forecast electricity demand\nof a SIDS member, Mauritius. A two years ahead forecast, for 2008 and 2009,\nwas derived using monthly time series data from years 1996 to 2007. The inputs\nconsidered were historical electricity demand and prices, temperature, humidity,\npopulation and GDP.\nTo facilitate the recognition and classification of medicinal plants that are\ncommonly used by Mauritians, a mobile application which can recognize sev-\nenty different medicinal plants has been developed in [216]. A convolutional\nneural network based on the TensorFlow framework has been used to create the\n111\n\nclassification model. The system has a recognition accuracy of more than 90%.\nOnce the plant is recognized, a number of useful information is displayed to\nthe user. Such information includes the common name of the plant, its English\nname and also its scientific name. The plant is also classified as either exotic\nor endemic followed by its medicinal applications and a short description. Con-\ntrary to similar systems, the application does not require an internet connection\nto work. Also, there are no pre-processing steps, and the images can be taken\nin broad daylight. Furthermore, any part of the plant can be photographed.\nIt is a fast and non-intrusive method to identify medicinal plants. This mobile\napplication will help the Mauritian population to increase their familiarity of\nmedicinal plants, help taxonomists to experiment with new ways of identifying\nplant species, and will also contribute to the protection of endangered plant\nspecies.\nThe research article in [217] investigates the application of supervised ma-\nchine learning techniques to predict the price of used cars in Mauritius. The\npredictions are based on historical data collected from daily newspapers. Differ-\nent techniques like multiple linear regression analysis, k-nearest neighbors, naive\nbayes and decision trees have been used to make the predictions. The predic-\ntions are then evaluated and compared in order to find those which provide the\nbest performances. A seemingly easy problem turned out to be indeed very dif-\nficult to resolve with high accuracy. All the four methods provided comparable\nperformance.\nIn [218] a Machine Learning Technique called the Support Vector Machine\nis adopted on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius (SEM) to determine if stock\nmarket returns are predictable based on information from past prices, allowing\narbitrage opportunities for abnormal profit generation. The serial correlation\ntest, used as benchmark, and the SVM technique show evidence that previous\ninformation on share prices as well as the indicators constructed are useful\nin predicting share price movements. The implications of the study are that\ninvestors have the prospect of adopting speculative strategies and profits from\ntrading based on information and advanced techniques and models are possible.\nIn this era of education and technology, it is undeniable that there is a grow-\ning interaction between machine and humans. Student performance is of prime\nimportance as education is the key to success. At the university of Mauritius,\nthe number of students enrolled in a course does not match the number of stu-\ndents graduating as not every student complete their academic cycle of 3 or\n4 years. Some extend their course duration as they have to repeat the whole\nyear or several modules, while others exit with a certificate or diploma since\nthey lack the required number of credits to obtain a degree. Unfortunately, the\nregistration of some students with very low average marks are terminated. The\nresearch work [219] investigates a machine learning model to predict the perfor-\nmance of university students on a yearly basis. The model will forecast student\nperformance and help take necessary actions before it is too late. The classifi-\ncation technique is used to train the proposed model using an existing student\ndataset. The training phase generates a training model that can then be used\nto predict student performance based on parameters such as attendance, marks,\n112\n\nstudy hours, health or average performance. Different algorithms are evaluated\nand the classification and prediction algorithms which are more accurate are\nrecommended\nThe Mauritius MI Strategy 2018, established by the government, aims at\nmaking MI a cornerstone of the next development model by recognizing the\npotential of technology to improve growth, productivity and quality of life. In\nthis regard, MI has already started to shape the legal sector, for instance, by\nassisting law practitioners to identify and minimize bias in client intake, offer\ninitial consultation solutions, expand the scope of information for law practition-\ners and predict the outcome of future legal cases, among others. Nevertheless,\nwhile the legal profession worldwide is facing pressure to innovate and trans-\nform, the emergence of MI is causing significant disruption to long-established\npractices in the legal world, especially since this particular sector has tradition-\nally under-utilized technology. The work in [220] seeks to assess the influence of\nMI on employees from the legal profession mainly in terms of their performance,\ntheir reaction, and adaptability to change and to identify the challenges faced\nby these employees in Mauritius in adopting MI for their operational activities.\nSentiment analysis is becoming increasing important with the rise in the\namount of content on social media. However, sentiment analysis remains chal-\nlenging for under-resourced languages such as Kreol Morisien (KM), the native\nlanguage of Mauritius. In fact, it has been observed that in Mauritius, social\nmedia comments often consist of more than one language among English, French\nand Kreol Morisien. In work in [221] first creates an annotated dataset of 1300\nsentences and then outline a framework through which sentiment analysis can\nbe performed on social media comments. We propose a KM sentiment analyzer\nusing two algorithms namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multinomial\nNaive Bayes (MNB). Our results show that SVM outperforms MNB for sen-\ntiment analysis in Kreol Morisien, achieving an accuracy of 66.15% after pre-\nprocessing techniques stopwords removal and spell checking are applied. This\npaper highlights the need to develop further tools in order to enable natural\nlanguage processing of Kreol Morisien.\nFruit Flies impact the field of agriculture in a negative way affecting the\neconomy of a host country. This work in [222] presents an identification system\nthat can be deployed on a mobile application. The identification system uses\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn the key visual features of fruit\nflies to be able to perform detections. The system comprises of two main as-\npects; a detection model and a classification model. The detection model uses\nSingle Snapshot Detector (SSD) MobileNet V2 FPNLite 640x640 model which is\nconverted to a TensorFlow Lite version and hosted locally on the mobile phone.\nThe classification model uses Xception model which is hosted on the Google\nCloud Platform where requests are made to the cloud from the mobile applica-\ntion. A custom image dataset of nine(9) fruit flies was created in two ways: Two\nfruit flies predominant in Mauritius were obtained from the Entomology Depart-\nment of the Ministry of Agro Industry and Food Security and photographs were\ntaken. The remaining fruit flies’ images were obtained through web scraping.\nTransfer learning has been successfully used to produce the SSD MobileNetV2\n113\n\nFPNLite 640x640 model with a loss of 31% and the Xception model with an\naccuracy of 75.5%.\nBirds communicate with their colonies through sound and inform them of\npotential problems like forest fires. The identification of bird sounds is therefore\nvery important and has the potential to solve some global problems. Convolu-\ntional neural networks (CNNs) are sophisticated deep learning algorithms that\nhave proven to be effective in image processing and in sound classification. The\nwork in [223] describes the work done to develop a tool using a deep learning\nmodel for classifying Mauritius bird sounds from audio recordings. A dataset\nobtained from the Xeno-canto bird song sharing site, which hosts a vast collec-\ntion of labeled and classified recordings, is used to fine-tune three pre-trained\nCNN models, namely InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 and RestNet50 and a custom\nmodel. The neural network’s input is represented by spectrograms created from\ndownloaded mp3 files. Time shifting and pitch stretching have been used for\ndata augmentation.

This has inevitably led to\na rise in diseases such as obesity, high blood pressure and heart diseases. To\nthis end, [224] developed FruVegy which is an android app which can automat-\nically identify fruits and vegetables and then display its nutritional values. The\napp can identify forty different fruits/vegetables. The app is specially targeting\nschool students who will find it easy and fun to use and this, we believe, will\nincrease their interest in the consumption of fruits and vegetables. Furthermore,\nthe names of the fruits and vegetables are also available in French and in Mau-\nritian Creole. A dataset of 1600 images from 40 different fruits and vegetables\nis proposed. There was an equal number of images for each fruit/vegetable.\nFeatures such as shape, color and texture were extracted from each image. Dif-\nferent machine learning classifiers were tested but random forest with 100 trees\nproduced the best result with an accuracy of 90.6%. However, with TensorFlow,\nan average accuracy of 98.1% was obtained under different scenarios.\n6.9.2\nSmall Businesses\nQubitica: Decentralized autonomous organization.

Anyone can contribute geographic information to Open-\nStreetMap (OSM), regardless of their level of experience or skills, which has\nraised concerns about quality. When reference data is not available to assess\nthe quality of OSM data, intrinsic methods that assess the data and its meta-\ndata can be used. In this study, we applied unsupervised machine learning for\nanalysing OSM history data to get a better understanding of who contributed\nwhen and how in Mozambique. Even though no absolute statements can be\nmade about the quality of the data, the results provide valuable insight into\nthe quality. Most of the data in Mozambique (93%) was contributed by a small\ngroup of active contributors (25%). However, these were less active than the\nOSM Foundation’s definition of active contributorship and the Humanitarian\nOpenStreetMap Team (HOT) definition for intermediate mappers. Compared\nto other contributor classifications, our results revealed a new class: contrib-\nutors who were new in the area and most likely attracted by HOT mapping\nevents during disaster relief operations in Mozambique in 2019. More studies in\ndifferent parts of the world would establish whether the patterns observed here\nare typical for developing countries. Intrinsic methods cannot replace ground\ntruthing or extrinsic methods, but provide alternative ways for gaining insight\nabout quality, and they can also be used to inform efforts to further improve\nthe quality. We provide suggestions for how contributor-focused intrinsic quality\nassessments could be further refined\nAccurate land use and land cover (LULC) mapping is essential for scientific\nand decision-making purposes. [226] maps LULC classes in the northern region\nof Mozambique between 2011 and 2020 based on Landsat time series processed\nby the Random Forest classifier in the Google Earth Engine platform.\nThe\nfeature selection method was used to reduce redundant data. The final maps\ncomprised five LULC classes (non-vegetated areas, built-up areas, croplands,\nopen evergreen and deciduous forests, and dense vegetation) with an overall\naccuracy ranging from 80.5% to 88.7%. LULC change detection between 2011\nand 2020 revealed that non-vegetated areas had increased by 0.7%, built-up\nby 2.0%, and dense vegetation by 1.3%. On the other hand, open evergreen\nand deciduous forests had decreased by 4.1% and croplands by 0.01%. The ap-\nproach used in this paper improves the current systematic mapping approach in\nMozambique by minimizing the methodological gaps and reducing the temporal\namplitude, thus supporting regional territorial development policies.\n[227] provides an overview of the most important practices in the field of MI\nused in educational contexts, with a focus on the main platforms used for teach-\ning (LMS) to support the development of a research work at Eduardo Mondlane\nUniversity in Mozambique.

A study was conducted to examine the impact\nof sample size and composition on the accuracy of classifying irrigated agricul-\nture in Mozambique’s Manica and Gaza provinces using three algorithms: ran-\ndom forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and Machine neural network\n(ANN). Four scenarios were considered, and the results showed that smaller\ndatasets can achieve high and sufficient accuracies, regardless of their compo-\nsition. However, the user and producer accuracies of irrigated agriculture do\nincrease when the algorithms are trained with larger datasets. The study also\nfound that the composition of the training data is important, with too few or too\nmany samples of the “irrigated agriculture” class decreasing overall accuracy.\nThe algorithms’ robustness depends on the training data’s composition, with\nRF and SVM showing less decrease and spread in accuracies than ANN. The\nstudy concludes that the training data size and composition are more important\nfor classification than the algorithms used. RF and SVM are more suitable for\nthe task as they are more robust or less sensitive to outliers than the ANN.\nOverall, the study provides valuable insights into mapping smallholder irrigated\nagriculture in sub-Saharan Africa using remote sensing techniques.\n[230] uses deep learning and Twitter for mapping in Mozambique. Accu-\nrate and detailed geographical information digitizing human activity patterns\nplays an essential role in response to natural disasters. Volunteered geograph-\nical information, in particular OpenStreetMap (OSM), shows great potential\nin providing the knowledge of human settlements to support humanitarian aid,\nwhile the availability and quality of OSM remains a major concern. The ma-\njority of existing works in assessing OSM data quality focus on either extrinsic\nor intrinsic analysis, which is insufficient to fulfill the humanitarian mapping\nscenario to a certain degree. This paper aims to explore OSM missing built-up\nareas from an integrative perspective of social sensing and remote sensing. First,\napplying hierarchical DBSCAN clustering algorithm, the clusters of geo-tagged\ntweets are generated as proxies of human active regions. Then a deep learning\nbased model fine-tuned on existing OSM data is proposed to further map the\nmissing built-up areas. Hit by Cyclone IdMI and Kenneth in 2019, the Republic\nof Mozambique is selected as the study area to evaluate the proposed method\nat a national scale. As a result, 13 OSM missing built-up areas are identified\nand mapped with an over 90% overall accuracy, being competitive compared\nto state-of-the-art products, which confirms the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod.\n117\n\n[231] compares seven machine learning algorithms. Logistic regression (LR)\nis the most common prediction model in medicine. In recent years, supervised\nmachine learning (ML) methods have gained popularity. However, there are\nmany concerns about ML utility for small sample sizes. In this study, we aim to\ncompare the performance of 7 algorithms in the prediction of 1-year mortality\nand clinical progression to AIDS in a small cohort of infants living with HIV\nfrom South Africa and Mozambique. The data set (n = 100) was randomly split\ninto 70% training and 30% validation set. Seven algorithms (LR, Random For-\nest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive\nBayes (NB), Machine Neural Network , and Elastic Net) were compared. The\nvariables included as predictors were the same across the models including so-\nciodemographic, virologic, immunologic, and maternal status features. For each\nof the models, a parameter tuning was performed to select the best-performing\nhyperparameters using 5 times repeated 10-fold cross-validation. A confusion-\nmatrix was built to assess their accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. RF ranked\nas the best algorithm in terms of accuracy (82,8%), sensitivity (78%), and AUC\n(0,73).\nRegarding specificity and sensitivity, RF showed better performance\nthan the other algorithms in the external validation and the highest AUC. LR\nshowed lower performance compared with RF, SVM, or KNN. The outcome of\nchildren living with perinatally acquired HIV can be predicted with consider-\nable accuracy using ML algorithms. Better models would benefit less specialized\nstaff in limited resources countries to improve prompt referral in case of high-risk\nclinical progression.\n[232] focuses on machine learning aspects of Bantu language Emakhuwa of\nMozambique. Major advancement in the performance of machine translation\nmodels has been made possible in part thanks to the availability of large-scale\nparallel corpora. But for most languages in the world, the existence of such cor-\npora is rare. Emakhuwa, a language spoken in Mozambique, is like most African\nlanguages low-resource in NLP terms. It lacks both computational and linguistic\nresources. In this paper we describe the creation of the Emakhuwa-Portuguese\nparallel corpus, which is a collection of texts from the Jehovah’s Witness web-\nsite and a variety of other sources including the African Story Book website,\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Mozambican legal documents.\nThe dataset contains 47,415 sentence pairs, amounting to 699,976 word tokens\nof Emakhuwa and 877,595 word tokens in Portuguese.

The project combines\ndata science, statistical processes, design-thinking techniques, and qualitative\nresearch methods. It actively seeks new data sources, new narratives, and new\n121\n\ncollaborations in order to keep iterating, and improving. Jetson initially fo-\ncused on understanding the catalysts that cause people to flee their homes in\nSomalia. Extensive field research resulted in the definition of ten key variables\nof forced displacement, such as commodity market prices, rainfall, and violent\nconflicts. Supported by machine learning, these variables inform an index that\nallows for short-term predictions of expected migration flows out of Somalia. To\nfulfil its mission, Jetson works in collaboration with partners such as the World\nMeteorological Organization, the Met Office in the UK, academia, and other\nUN institutions such as UN Global Pulse. Overall, Project Jetson demonstrates\nan innovative use of machine learning in the context of forced migration move-\nments: It runs short-term predictions more efficiently, at a higher frequency,\nand at lower costs than traditional calculations.

Take Namanga, a densely packed\ninformal settlement in eastern Dar es Salaam. Despite abutting some of the\ncity’s wealthiest and greenest neighborhoods, residents of Namanga must en-\ndure weather extremes with barely any green cover to provide shade or absorb\nrun-off from sudden downpours. Understanding which districts have ample or\ninadequate tree canopy cover is challenging but it is becoming more feasible\ndue to increasingly detailed satellite imagery. Machine learning algorithms are\na key technology for interpreting such imagery. Still, algorithms to detect fea-\ntures such as tree canopy are only as good as the data they are built on. When\ntheir team applied an off-the-shelf tree detection algorithm (developed using\na tree canopy dataset from California) to satellite imagery of Dar es Salaam,\nthe results were unsatisfactory [336]. Data labeling is the process of adding\nmeaningful information to raw data so that computers can learn to recognize\npatterns in it, for example, annotating recordings of human speech with the\nwords they contain or identifying objects in photographs. To produce detailed\ntree-cover maps of Dar es Salaam and Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone,\nthe Resilience Academy students began by developing their own large dataset\nof labeled satellite imagery. Using an open-source labeling tool developed by\nAzavea, the students loaded high-resolution satellite imagery, divided it into\ngrid cells, and drew accurate boundaries around the tree canopy. By labeling\njust 1% of the city in this way, the resulting dataset enabled a machine learning\nmodel to learn how to recognize its trees, distinguishing tree canopy from grass,\nbuildings and other features, even in shady conditions.\n6.16\nUganda\nUganda\n2020-2023\nConcrete Actions\nResearch\n✓\nspeech datasets\nSMB\n✓\nChil Ai Lab,\nGlobal\nAuto Systems, Weke-\nbere\nInformal\nEconomy\n✓\nGovernment ✓\nArtificial\nIntelligence\nand Data Science Lab\nTable 52: MI in Uganda\n124\n\n6.16.1\nResearch\nThe project [337] aims deliver open, accessible, and high-quality text and speech\ndatasets for low-resource East African languages from Uganda, Tanzania, and\nKenya.

This was done in order to gain an in-depth overview of the\ncurrent state of the art for environmental pollutant monitoring in affected min-\ning towns. According to the findings presented here, the country has not made\nenough investments in environmental monitoring technologies and instead relies\non funded projects that render the agency responsible for preventing and con-\ntrolling ambient pollution inoperable after the projects are completed, despite\nthe fact that there are plenty of mineral resources available and more are still to\nbe discovered. The research suggested new techniques for comparing ambient\nair pollutant levels to national guideline limits based on the limitations of its\nresults. This study uses data from an ongoing obstetrical cohort in Lusaka,\nZambia that uses early pregnancy ultrasound to estimate GA. Our intent was\nto identify the best set of parameters commonly available at delivery to cor-\nrectly categorize births as either preterm (37 weeks) or term, compared to GA\nassigned by early ultrasound as the gold standard. Trained midwives conducted\na newborn assessment (72 hours) and collected maternal and neonatal data\nat the time of delivery or shortly thereafter. New Ballard Score (NBS), last\nmenstrual period (LMP), and birth weight were used individually to assign GA\nat delivery and categorize each birth as either preterm or term. Additionally,\nmachine learning techniques incorporated combinations of these measures with\nseveral maternal and newborn characteristics associated with prematurity and\nSGA to develop GA at delivery and preterm birth prediction models. The dis-\ntribution and accuracy of all models were compared to early ultrasound dating.\nWithin our live-born cohort to date (n = 862), the median GA at delivery by\nearly ultrasound was 39.4 weeks. Among assessed newborns with complete data\nincluded in this analysis (n = 468), the median GA by ultrasound was 39.6\nweeks. Using machine learning, we identified a combination of six accessible\nparameters (LMP, birth weight, twin delivery, maternal height, hypertension in\nlabor, and HIV serostatus) that can be used by machine learning to outperform\ncurrent GA prediction methods. For preterm birth prediction, this combination\nof covariates correctly classified 94% of newborns and achieved an area under\nthe curve (AUC) of 0.9796. We identified a parsimonious list of variables that\ncan be used by machine learning approaches to improve accuracy of preterm\nnewborn identification. Our best-performing model included LMP, birth weight,\ntwin delivery, HIV serostatus, and maternal factors associated with SGA. These\nvariables are all easily collected at delivery, reducing the skill and time required\nby the frontline health worker to assess GA.\nThe work in [290] presents a method to identify poor households in data-\nscarce countries by leveraging information contained in nationally representative\nhousehold surveys. It employs standard statistical learning techniques - cross-\nvalidation and parameter regularization - which together reduce the extent to\nwhich the model is over-fitted to match the idiosyncracies of observed survey\ndata. The automated framework satisfies three important constraints of this\ndevelopment setting: i) The prediction model uses at most ten questions, which\nlimits the costs of data collection; ii) No computation beyond simple arithmetic\n127\n\nis needed to calculate the probability that a given household is poor, immedi-\nately after data on the ten indicators is collected; and iii) One specification of the\nmodel (i.e. one scorecard) is used to predict poverty throughout a country that\nmay be characterized by significant sub-national differences. Using survey data\nfrom Zambia, the model’s out-of-sample predictions distinguish poor households\nfrom non-poor households using information contained in ten questions.\nAssessing tax gaps - the difference between the potential and actual taxes\nraised - plays a vital role in achieving positive domestic revenue objectives\nthrough improved and reformed taxation.\nThis is particularly pertinent for\ngrowth outcomes in developing countries. This study in [291] uses a bottom-up\napproach based on micro-level audit information to estimate the extent of tax\nmisreporting in Zambia. Our methods predict the extent of tax evasion using a\nregression and a machine learning algorithm based on a sample of audited firms,\nafter which we estimate tax gaps using a standard approach. We estimate total\ntax gaps as 56 per cent and 47 per cent for the two approaches, respectively.\nThese gaps are mainly driven by corporate taxes. Applying our gap to key in-\ndustries shows that the extractives sector in Zambia records the highest gaps in\nterms of CIT and one of the lowest gaps in terms of VAT.\nThe World Health Organization recommends chest radiography to facilitate\ntuberculosis (TB) screening. However, chest radiograph interpretation exper-\ntise remains limited in many regions. [292] developed a deep learning system\n(DLS) to detect active pulmonary TB on chest radiographs and compare its\nperformance to that of radiologists. A DLS was trained and tested using retro-\nspective chest radiographs (acquired between 1996 and 2020) from 10 countries.\nTo improve generalization, large-scale chest radiograph pretraining, attention\npooling, and semi-supervised learning (“noisy-student”) were incorporated. The\nDLS was evaluated in a four-country test set (China, India, the United States,\nand Zambia) and in a mining population in South Africa, with positive TB con-\nfirmed with microbiological tests or nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT).\nThe performance of the DLS was compared with that of 14 radiologists. The\nauthors studied the efficacy of the DLS compared with that of nine radiologists\nusing the Obuchowski-Rockette-Hillis procedure. A deep learning method was\nfound to be noninferior to radiologists for the determination of active tubercu-\nlosis on digital chest radiographs.\nDeep Learning System is used in [293] to Screen for Diabetic Retinopathy\nin an Underprivileged African Population with Diabetes. Diabetes exerts an\nemerging burden in Zambia. Related complications such as diabetic retinopa-\nthy (DR) are expected to increase dramatically in prevalence. Challenged by\nshortage of ophthalmic services and poor accessibility to DR screening, the ap-\nplication of machine intelligence ( using deep learning may be an alternative\nsolution.\nThis study aims to evaluate the real-world clinical effectiveness of\na DL system in screening for DR and vision-threatening DR (VTDR) in the\nZambian population with diabetes. A total of 4513 images from 3101 eyes of\n1578 Zambians with diabetes were prospectively recruited for this study. Two-\nfield color 45-degree retinal fundus photographs were captured for each eye and\ngraded according to International Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy Sever-\n128\n\nity scale. Referable DR was defined as moderate non-proliferative DR (NPDR)\nor worse, diabetic macular edema and ungradable images; VTDR was designated\nas severe NPDR and proliferative DR. With reference to the retinal specialists’\ngrading, we calculated the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), sensi-\ntivity and specificity for referable DR, and the detection rate of VTDR, using an\nEnsemble convolutional neural network. The developed DL system shows clin-\nically acceptable performance in detection of referable DR and VTDR for the\nZambian population. This demonstrates the potential application to adopt such\nsophisticated cutting-edge MI technology for the underprivileged population.\n6.18\nZimbabwe\nZimbabwe\n2020-2023\nConcrete Actions\nResearch\n✓\nNeotree\nSMB\n✓\nInformal\nEconomy\n✓\nGovernment ✓\nTable 54: MI in Zimbabwe\n6.18.1\nResearch\nEfficient and effective healthcare systems utilize the available data at every level\nto provide evidence-based care and improve procedures and practice in order to\nmeet the three goals of healthcare institutions - access, quality and efficiency.\nRegardless of the changing child health needs and often failure by traditional\nhealthcare models to cope, most of the public health institutions in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica are not providing data-driven pediatrics to meet the ever-changing child\nhealth needs. There is a lack of utilization of the data collected by the routine\nhealth information systems to provide evidence-based and personalized pedi-\natrics. The study in [294] employed an exploratory research design to explore\nthe opportunities, and potential challenges of data-driven pediatrics based on\nthe lessons learnt from the introduction of the electronic health record and\nNeotree (a digital health system deployed in Zimbabwe and Malawi to help\nhealth workers manage neonates’ health) in Makonde District. Twenty public\nhealth workers participated in interviews and focus groups and reports from\nthe district health information system provided further insights. The study re-\nvealed that data-driven pediatrics could improve access, efficiency and quality\nof pediatric care, regardless of such potential challenges as fear of medico-legal\nhazards, centralization of decision-making, resistance by healthcare workers,\nnetwork challenges and computer illiteracy. To increase the chances of success,\nthe following lessons learnt from electronic health record and neotree introduc-\ntion could help: start small, sensitize communities first, involve line healthcare\n129\n\nworkers from the beginning, do not train in a haste and demystify technology’s\npurpose. The study revealed that there are pediatricians and nurses willing to\nshift to data-driven pediatrics if the technologies are available.\nThe work in [295] studies vehicle damage. According to the United Nations\nRoad Safety Performance Review-Zimbabwe report, every 15 minutes, five peo-\nple die in road accidents within Zimbabwe, recording the highest number of ac-\ncidents in the SADC region. The situation has brought more pressure and work\nin the insurance sector as they are expected to process all the claims accurately\nand timely. Deep learning entails automation, enhancement, analysis, and high\naccuracy in areas like speech recognition, object detection, and language trans-\nlation. In this paper, two modern deep learning algorithms MobileNetV2 and\nDenseNetV121 were used to develop the vehicle damage classification models.\nThe models were used to detect damaged main features of a car, which are: the\ndoor, bumper, windscreen, tail lamp, and headlamp. Mobile NetV 2’s53 lay-\ners and DenseNet121’s121 layers produced high accuracy rates for identifying\ndamaged parts in vehicles. However, DenseNetV2 produced a higher accuracy\nof 84 & than MobileNetV2, with an accuracy rate of 78%. The models also\nused low computational resources than the traditional algorithms making them\napplicable in different insurance companies as they can be easily embedded into\nclient’s mobile phones.\nThe work in [296] predicts depression Among Adolescents. Depression being\na behavioural health disorder is a serious health concern in Zimbabwe and all\nover the world. If depression goes unaddressed, the consequences are detrimen-\ntal and have an impact on the way one behaves as an individual and at the\nsocietal level. Despite the number of individuals who could benefit from treat-\nment for behavioural health concerns, their difficulties are often unidentified and\nunaddressed through treatment. Technology carries the unrealized potential to\nidentify people at risk of behavioural health conditions and to inform prevention\nand intervention strategies\n7\nOn MI adoption metrics and evaluation of\ncountries MI strategies\nOn MI adoption metrics\nMany people are referring to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of\nTechnology (UTAUT) 1, 2, 3, etc., to explain the adoption of MI, blockchain,\nCBDC, autonomous vehicles, etc. From a game theory perspective, UTAUT\nis not universal, and it is not a one-size-fits-all model. To date, there is no\nsingle method that evaluates the adoption of all technologies in a way that is\nuniversal and cohesive. UTAUT stands for Unified Theory of Acceptance and\nUse of Technology. It’s a model that aims to understand how individuals adopt\nand use new technologies.\n130\n\nWhat is UTAUT in MI ?\nIn the context of MI, UTAUT can be applied to study factors influencing the\nacceptance and use of intelligent technologies. The key components of UTAUT\nin MI typically include:\n• Performance Expectancy: Users’ belief that using the technology will en-\nhance their performance.\n• Effort Expectancy: The perceived ease of use and minimal effort required\nto use the technology.\n• Social Influence: The impact of social factors and opinions on the user’s\ndecision to adopt MI.\n• Facilitating Conditions: The degree to which users believe that the nec-\nessary resources and support are available for using the technology.\n• Behavioral Intention: Users’ intention to use MI based on the factors\nmentioned.\nLimitations of UTAUT in MI\nWhile UTAUT is a valuable framework, it has some limitations in the context\nof MI, including:\n• Lack of Specificity: UTAUT may not capture the unique challenges and\nnuances associated with different types of MI technologies.\n• Dynamic Nature: MI evolves rapidly, and UTAUT might struggle to keep\nup with emerging technologies and user perceptions.\n• Cultural Variations: The model may not fully account for countries cul-\ntural differences in the acceptance of MI, as cultural factors play a signif-\nicant role in technology adoption.\n• Ethical Concerns: UTAUT primarily focuses on user acceptance but may\nnot adequately address ethical considerations related to MI, which are\ncrucial in this domain.\n• Limited Emotional Factors: The emotional aspect of human-machine in-\nteraction is not extensively covered, and emotions can significantly influ-\nence technology acceptance.\n• MI researchers often need to complement UTAUT with additional frame-\nworks or consider these limitations when applying it to the rapidly evolving\nfield of MI.\nWe provide below specific practical examples in MI where UTAUT fails\n131\n\n• Deep Learning vs. Shallow Learning: UTAUT may not capture the nu-\nanced differences in user acceptance between deep learning and traditional\nshallow learning methods due to the distinctive nature of these technolo-\ngies.\n• Explainable MI (XMI): UTAUT might not adequately address the chal-\nlenges associated with user acceptance of Explainable MI systems, where\nusers often prioritize transparency and interpretability over performance.\n• Humanoid Robots: When it comes to the adoption of humanoid robots\npowered by MI, UTAUT may not sufficiently consider the impact of an-\nthropomorphism and emotional factors on user acceptance.\n• Biometric Surveillance Systems: UTAUT might fall short in addressing\nthe concerns and ethical considerations associated with the acceptance\nof MI in biometric surveillance systems, where privacy and security play\ncrucial roles.\n• Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): UTAUT may not effectively\ncapture the unique challenges in user acceptance of GANs, where the\ntechnology is used to generate realistic synthetic data, raising concerns\nabout its ethical implications and potential misuse.\n• Chatbots: UTAUT may struggle to fully capture the user acceptance dy-\nnamics of chatbots, especially considering factors like natural language\nunderstanding, context awareness, and the ability to engage users in mean-\ningful conversations.\n• Conversational Agents in Medicine: When applied to conversational agents\nin healthcare, UTAUT might not address the specific concerns related to\ntrust, accuracy, and privacy that are crucial in the adoption of MI-driven\nmedical conversational agents.\n• Audio-to-Audio Bots: UTAUT may not adequately consider the unique\nchallenges associated with user acceptance of audio-to-audio bots, where\nthe conversion of spoken language to another language or format intro-\nduces complexities not fully addressed by traditional UTAUT factors.\n• Augmented Reality in MI: UTAUT may not sufficiently encompass the\nuser acceptance factors specific to the integration of MI into augmented\nreality applications, where factors like user experience in a mixed reality\nenvironment become significant.\n• Personalized MI Assistants: UTAUT might not fully account for the in-\ntricacies of user acceptance in personalized MI assistants that adapt to\nindividual preferences and behaviors, as the personalization aspect intro-\nduces additional dimensions beyond the traditional UTAUT framework.\n132\n\nGame Theory outperforms UTAUT\nA game theory approach for technology adoption can incorporate the following\nelements to outperform the standard UTAUT:\n• Multi-Agent Interactions: Consider the technology adoption as a dynamic\ngame with multiple interacting agents, such as MI research funding spon-\nsors, research investors, network of advertisers, MI sponsored ambas-\nsadors, users, developers, and policymakers. Each agent’s strategy and\ndecisions impact others, reflecting the complex interactions in the real-\nworld adoption scenario.\n• Incentive Structures: Introduce incentive structures for users and devel-\nopers that align with the specific features of the technology. For instance,\nrewards for developers creating explainable MI or penalties for users en-\ngaging in malicious use of the technology.\n• Dynamic Payoffs: Model dynamic payoffs that evolve over time, reflecting\nthe changing nature of technology and user perceptions. This accommo-\ndates the rapid advancements in MI and the evolving needs and preferences\nof users.\n• Privacy Considerations: Incorporate privacy as a strategic element in the\ngame, recognizing its critical role in user decision-making. Agents may\nhave different preferences regarding privacy, affecting their strategies and\ninteractions within the technology adoption game.\n• Adversarial Scenarios: Account for adversarial scenarios where users or\ndevelopers may strategically exploit vulnerabilities or engage in unethical\npractices.\nThis helps in understanding and mitigating risks associated\nwith technology adoption.\nBy integrating these specificities into a game theory framework, the model can\nprovide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics involved\nin the adoption of advanced technologies, outperforming the standard UTAUT\nin capturing the nuances of the interactions between actors and technologies.\nTo date,\n• UTAUT Not Unified: UTAUT 1,2,3 lack unity in addressing the diverse\nchallenges of technology adoption, suggesting it falls short of providing a\ncohesive framework.\n• Not Universal: UTAUT is not universal in its applicability, indicating that\nits principles may not effectively cover the wide range of technologies and\nuser contexts.\n• Not One-Size-Fits-All: UTAUT is not a one-size-fits-all solution, implying\nthat it may not sufficiently adapt to the specificities and complexities\ninherent in different technologies and user interactions.\n133\n\n• MFTG Outperforms UTAUT: A simple Mean-Field-Type Game (MFTG)\napproach surpasses UTAUT in MI, implying that incorporating basic game\ntheory principles better captures the dynamics of technology adoption.\nOn MI indexes or metrics of countries\nMI indexes for countries assess their capabilities, strategies, and development\nin machine intelligence.\nSome notable MI indexes include:\n• Global MI Index: Provides a comprehensive assessment of MI readiness,\nresearch, development, and application across various countries.\n• MI Readiness Index: Focuses on a country’s preparedness for MI adoption,\nconsidering factors like infrastructure, education, and innovation.\n• Government MI Readiness Index: Evaluates how well governments are\npositioned to adopt and harness the benefits of MI for public services and\ngovernance.\n• MI Policy and Practice Index: Assesses the policies and practices related\nto MI governance, ethics, and regulations in different countries.\n• MI Innovation Index: Measures a country’s innovation in MI, considering\nresearch output, startup activity, and investment in MI-related industries.\n• MI Ethics Index: Evaluates countries based on their commitment to ethi-\ncal considerations in MI development and deployment, assessing policies,\nregulations, and adherence to ethical guidelines.\n• MI Inclusion Index: Measures the inclusivity of MI initiatives within a\ncountry, considering factors such as diversity in MI workforce, accessibility\nof MI technologies, and efforts to minimize biases.\n• MI Education Index: Assesses a country’s educational infrastructure and\ninitiatives related to MI, including the availability of MI courses, research\nprograms, and the integration of MI education at various levels.\n• MI Industry Adoption Index: Examines the extent to which industries\nwithin a country are adopting and integrating MI technologies into their\noperations, providing insights into economic impact and competitiveness.\n• MI Investment Index: Focuses on the level of financial investment and\nfunding dedicated to MI research, development, and implementation, re-\nflecting a country’s commitment to MI advancements.\n134\n\nLimitations of MI indexes in Africa\nThe key limitations of MI indexes for countries include:\n• Data Availability and Quality: The accuracy and reliability of these in-\ndexes heavily depend on the availability and quality of data. Inconsistent\nor incomplete data can lead to skewed assessments.\n• Static Nature: Index rankings are often based on static snapshots, which\nmight not capture the dynamic and evolving nature of MI ecosystems.\nRapid changes in technology and policies can quickly impact a country’s\nstanding.\n• Subjectivity in Metrics: The choice of metrics and their subjective in-\nterpretation can introduce bias. Different index creators may prioritize\ncertain factors over others, leading to variations in rankings.\n• Lack of Standardization: There is a lack of standardized criteria across\nindexes, making it challenging to compare and aggregate results. Different\nmethodologies and criteria can lead to discrepancies in rankings.\n• Inability to Capture Informal MI Activity: Some indexes may struggle to\naccount for informal MI activities, grassroots initiatives, or developments\nin non-traditional sectors, potentially underestimating a country’s overall\nMI landscape.\n• Ethical Considerations: Certain indexes may not adequately address eth-\nical considerations, such as the responsible use of MI or the impact on\nprivacy and human rights, which are essential aspects of MI development.\n• Limited Focus: Indexes often focus on specific aspects of MI, such as\nreadiness or ethics, but may not provide a holistic view.\nThis limited\nfocus can overlook important interactions between different components\nof MI ecosystems.\n• Global Perspective: Some indexes may lack a truly global perspective,\nfocusing more on developed countries and potentially neglecting the con-\ntributions and challenges faced by emerging economies in the MI space.\nCurrent MI indexes are unethical\n• Lack of Audio2Audio Processing for African Languages: Current MI tech-\nnologies, including MI indexes, do not adequately address the need for\nAudio2Audio processing, particularly for African languages. This crucial\naspect, which could benefit the local population in Africa, is largely over-\nlooked in existing evaluations of MI readiness and capacity.\n• Underrepresentation of African Cultures: Existing MI technologies and\nindexes often fail to incorporate the rich diversity of African cultures. The\n135\n\nabsence of cultural nuances and specificities in these evaluations reflects\na significant gap in understanding and catering to the unique contexts of\nAfrican societies, limiting the relevance and accuracy of MI rankings for\nthe continent.\n• National MI Strategy: Having a report or white paper that compiles a\nset of recommendations does not necessarily lead to advanced MI country.\nHaving a national MI strategy outlined in a white paper should not carry\nthe same weight as the actual implementation of MI that is actively used\nand beneficial to the local population. Concrete implementation and im-\npact on the ground should be given more emphasis than the existence of\na strategic document.\n• National MI & Robotics Center: The mere establishment of an MI and\nrobotics center by some countries, devoid of actual contributions to lo-\ncal MI research, training, innovation, and understanding, should not be\nequated with meaningful progress. Centers that lack substantial engage-\nment with local issues, fail to provide MI training for the community, and\nfocus only on filmographies and metaverse glasses are more about political\nposturing in the MI race than making a tangible impact. Such govern-\nmental actions should not carry the same weight as actively implemented\nand utilized MI technologies that address real challenges in Africa.\n• Ambiguity of Concepts: MI ’readiness’ and ’capacity’ are ambiguous con-\ncepts that lack standardized definitions, making it challenging to measure\nthem consistently, especially in Africa.\n• Inconsistent Proxy Indicators: Current MI indexes rely on inconsistent\nand divergent proxy indicators to gauge a country’s readiness or capacity\nfor MI, leading to unreliable comparisons.\n• Unequal Weighting of Indicators: Some indexes assign equal weight to\nindicators that represent vastly different national characteristics, creating\nan imbalanced evaluation.\n• Inappropriate Metrics: Metrics such as public investments in MI may not\nprovide a fair comparison between states, as they do not consider how\nthese investments are spent or the quality of MI produced in the area, in\nthe country, within Africa and across the globe.\n• Lack of Differentiation: Metrics related to the number of ’MI players,’\nprojects, or services often fail to differentiate between large, influential\norganizations and smaller ventures with less impact on MI development.\n• Unreliable Data Sources: Some key metrics rely on potentially unreliable\ndata sources, such as a LinkedIn dataset, Twitter posts, or political Ads,\nthat may include distorted claims about MI skills.\n136\n\n• Self-Reporting Bias: Indicators of MI adoption by organizations often rely\non self-reporting, and online surveys, introducing potential inaccuracies.\n• Lack of Transparency: Some rankings lack transparency in their method-\nology and raw data, making it difficult to assess the credibility of their\nfindings.\n• Regional Biases: There is evidence of potential regional biases in index\ndata, with raw data on journal citations under-representing academic out-\nput from Africa and the Global South.\n• Demographic Biases: LinkedIn, Twitter, Wechat, key data sources, may\nunder-represent MI penetration in certain regions of Africa due to varia-\ntions in user rates worldwide.\n• Under-Representation of Africa and the Global South: African authors\nand Global South authors, articles, and journals may be under-represented\nin citation counts, contributing to potential biases in assessing MI devel-\nopment.\n• Limited Data on Methodology: Lack of publicly released detailed method-\nology for certain indexes raises concerns about the credibility of their rank-\nings.\n• Overemphasis on Western Institutions: A disproportionate number of data\nand indicators are compiled, sorted, and presented by Western institu-\ntions, potentially skewing the evaluation towards Western perspectives.\n• Inadequate Representation of Non-Male Experts: Some indexes’ staffing\nand advisory bodies lack adequate representation of non-male experts,\nintroducing potential biases in the evaluation process.\n• Race-Like Approach Encouragement: Some indexes actively encourage a\nrace-like approach to MI policy, potentially promoting competition rather\nthan collaborative development.\n• Overemphasis on Quantity: Metrics focusing on the number of MI projects\nor services may prioritize quantity over quality, neglecting the impact and\ninnovation of each project. In Africa, the quality should be more useful\nto the local population.\n• Limited Contextual Understanding: Indexes may lack a nuanced under-\nstanding of the local context, leading to misinterpretations and misrepre-\nsentations of a country’s MI development.\n• Technological Complexity Oversimplification: The complexity of MI de-\nvelopment cannot be adequately captured by a single ranking, oversimpli-\nfying the intricate factors involved.\n137\n\n• Insufficient Adaptability: MI indexes may struggle to adapt to the evolving\nlandscape of MI development, rendering them less effective in providing\naccurate and relevant assessments over time.\nFor all these reasons, Current MI indexes, MI readiness, and MI rankings in\nAfrica are currently unethical methodologies. We should prioritize making them\nethical and propose alternative methodologies that account for the specificities\nof each country.\n8\nMulti-Scale MI Ethics in Africa\nHere, Ethics refers to the study of moral principles, values, and conduct that\nguide individuals, groups, or societies in distinguishing between right and wrong\nactions. It provides a framework for evaluating the morality of decisions and\nbehaviors, shaping standards of behavior based on concepts such as fairness, jus-\ntice, honesty, and integrity. Ethics encompasses rich notions that guide moral\ndecision-making and behavior. At its core are moral principles such as honesty,\nintegrity, and justice, which underpin ethical frameworks. Values play a crucial\nrole, representing core beliefs that influence priorities and choices. Rights, both\nindividual and collective, emphasize entitlements and freedoms.\nDuties and\nresponsibilities arise from societal expectations and professional roles. Virtues,\nincluding compassion and empathy, contribute to positive character traits. Con-\nsequences and outcomes provide a lens for evaluating actions, aligning with eth-\nical theories like utilitarianism. Fairness and justice ensure equitable treatment,\nwhile integrity underscores consistency and honesty. Autonomy recognizes in-\ndividuals’ right to independent decisions, and respect acknowledges the intrin-\nsic value of each person.\nOther notions include accountability, beneficence,\nnonmaleficence, empathy, sympathy, cultural competence, beneficence, confi-\ndentiality, informed consent, social responsibility, empathy, altruism, pluralism,\npaternalism, reciprocity, and sustainability, collectively forming the intricate\nfabric of ethical considerations.\nThe current practices of MI ethics in Africa are not ethical\nPaternalism is a concept in ethics and governance that involves a person or au-\nthority making decisions or taking actions on behalf of others with the belief that\nit is for their best interest, often without their explicit consent. This approach\nis rooted in a sense of protection or guidance, assuming that the paternalistic\nparty knows what is best for the individuals or groups involved. While pater-\nnalism may be well-intentioned, it can raise ethical concerns as it may infringe\non individual autonomy and decision-making.\nCritics argue that individuals\nshould have the freedom to make their own choices, even if those choices in-\nvolve potential risks or mistakes. Paternalism is often debated in contexts such\nas engineering and healthcare, where decisions about medical treatments and\nengineering threshold designs may be made by healthcare professionals and en-\ngineers for the patient’s and users presumed well-being.\n138\n\nThe assessment of what is ethical can vary across cultures, philosophical per-\nspectives, and individual beliefs, but it generally involves the adherence to prin-\nciples that promote positive and virtuous conduct. MI ethics is a multifaceted\ndomain encompassing numerous notions to guide the responsible development\nand deployment of MI. Fundamental principles include fairness, ensuring unbi-\nased outcomes and mitigating algorithmic biases. Transparency is vital, empha-\nsizing the need for clear explanations of MI decision-making processes. Account-\nability holds developers and organizations responsible for the ethical impact of\nMI systems.\nPrivacy concerns address the responsible handling of personal\ndata, while security focuses on preventing misuse and safeguarding against ma-\nlicious activities. Bias mitigation is crucial for identifying and rectifying biases\nin MI algorithms, promoting equitable results. Explainability ensures that MI\ndecisions are understandable to diverse stakeholders. Human-centered design\nprioritizes the well-being and interests of humans in MI development. Inclusiv-\nity advocates for considering diverse perspectives and benefiting a broad range\nof communities. Environmental impact considerations assess and minimize the\necological footprint of MI systems. Additional notions include autonomy, con-\nsent, data governance, algorithmic transparency, algorithmic accountability, so-\ncial responsibility, cultural sensitivity, global collaboration, ethical governance,\nhuman augmentation ethics, collaborative intelligence, digital divide reduction,\nresponsible MI education, ethical data sourcing, dual-use technology awareness,\nethical advertising, participatory design, ethical MI research, safety conscious-\nness, MI for social good, interdisciplinary collaboration, long-term impact as-\nsessment, value alignment, and continuous stakeholder engagement, collectively\nshaping the ethical landscape of MI.\nDeploying MI technologies in certain countries in Africa without the consent\nof the population, authorities, and in a language not widely spoken is generally\nconsidered unethical. Ethical MI deployment involves respecting the autonomy\nand rights of individuals and communities, obtaining informed consent, and en-\nsuring that technologies are culturally and linguistically appropriate. Failure\nto seek consent and address linguistic and cultural considerations may lead to\nissues such as lack of user understanding, potential biases, and violations of\nprivacy and human rights. Ethical MI practices prioritize transparency, inclu-\nsivity, and the well-being of the affected communities, and any deployment that\nneglects these considerations raises significant ethical concerns.\nThe current MI is not inclusive in Africa\nIn its current form, MI is not inclusive as it excludes a significant portion of\nAfrican language users who predominantly engage with audio content. Con-\nsequently, there is a lack of MI ethics in most African countries. Mere copy-\npasting of ethics guidelines does not inherently render MI ethical in the African\ncontext.\nIn practice in most African countries, ethics is multimodal, multi-\ndimensional, context-dependent, and culturally sensitive.\nUnlike the global\nstereotypes, Africa is multicultural, varying from one region to another and\nsometimes within the same country. So, what MI ethics can provide a coherent\n139\n\nand culturally respectful guideline?\nThe classical MI ethics guidelines face several limitations, particularly in\ninformal sectors in Africa. MI ethics guidelines often reflect Western perspec-\ntives and may not adequately consider the diverse cultural contexts in informal\nsectors across Africa.\nCultural nuances and ethical considerations may vary\nsignificantly, making it challenging to have universal guidelines that address\nall cultural intricacies. Informal sectors in Africa often experience a significant\ndigital divide, with limited access to technology and digital literacy. MI ethics\nguidelines may assume a certain level of technological infrastructure and aware-\nness, making their application challenging in contexts where such resources are\nscarce. Many MI ethics guidelines are presented in languages that may not be\naccessible or easily understood by individuals in informal sectors who may have\nlimited proficiency in official languages or foreign languages.\nThis language\nbarrier poses challenges in disseminating and implementing ethical principles\neffectively. The informal sectors in Africa operate under unique economic dy-\nnamics that may not align with formal economic structures. MI ethics guidelines\ncrafted for formal settings may not address the specific challenges, needs, and\nethical considerations prevalent in informal economies. Informal sectors often\nlack robust regulatory frameworks and oversight. The absence of clear regula-\ntions makes it difficult to enforce MI ethics guidelines, leaving informal workers\nand businesses vulnerable to ethical violations without proper accountability\nmechanisms. Awareness of MI ethics guidelines may be low in informal sectors\ndue to limited access to information and educational resources. Individuals and\nbusinesses may not be aware of ethical considerations related to MI, hindering\nthe adoption of ethical practices.\nInformal sectors face resource constraints,\nlimiting their ability to invest in MI technologies that align with ethical guide-\nlines. Prioritizing ethical considerations may take a backseat when basic survival\nand economic challenges are more pressing. Power imbalances within informal\nsectors, such as gender and socioeconomic disparities, may exacerbate ethical\nchallenges. MI ethics guidelines may not sufficiently address these imbalances,\nleaving certain groups more vulnerable to negative impacts of MI technologies.\nRapid changes in technology may outpace the adaptability of MI ethics guide-\nlines in informal sectors. Guidelines may struggle to keep pace with evolving MI\napplications, leading to gaps in addressing emerging ethical issues. Historical\nand societal factors may contribute to a trust deficit in certain informal sec-\ntors. MI ethics guidelines may face resistance or skepticism, requiring tailored\napproaches to build trust and ensure effective ethical practices.\nWe look at a 10-row, 7-column table of ethics. We have selected only a few\ntopics as rows as an illustration of context-sensibility of ethics and the topics\ncan be complemented.

or\ninitiatives while simultaneously competing in other areas. It involves a combina-\ntion of cooperation and competition to achieve mutual benefits for the involved\nparties. This strategy recognizes that competitors can sometimes create value\nby working together on common goals, even as they compete in other aspects of\ntheir business. Co-opetition is often seen in industries where there are shared\ninterests, such as standard-setting, research and development, or addressing\ncommon challenges.\nWhat is co-opetitive game theory ?\nCo-opetitive game theory is an extension of traditional game theory that ex-\nplores scenarios where actors engage in both cooperative and competitive inter-\nactions simultaneously. In co-opetitive situations, participants collaborate on\ncertain aspects of a game while competing in others.\nWhat is Co-opetitive Mean-Field-Type Game Theory?\nCo-opetitive mean-field-type game theory explores scenarios where actors en-\ngage in both cooperative and competitive interactions simultaneously. In co-\nopetitive situations of mean-field type, participants collaborate on certain as-\npects of a game while competing in others. What makes them of mean-field\ntype is their dynamics and/or payoff functions, which depend not only on state-\naction pairs but also on the distribution of state-action pairs. These games do\nnot necessarily consider a large number of decision-makers. They do not need\nto assume symmetry, exchangeability, or indistinguishability per type. These\ngames capture more interactions in real-world applications that are risk-aware\nand non-symmetric, involving both cooperation, competition, partial altruism,\npartial spite, etc.\n196\n\nMultiscale multimodal Ethics as co-opetition\nThe multiscale multimodal Ethics can be seen in Co-opetitive Mean-Field-Type\nGame Theory through various dimensions: Individual:\n• Transparency:\nIndividuals participating in co-opetitive scenarios need\ntransparency in understanding the collaborative and competitive aspects,\nfostering trust among participants.\n• Fairness: Ensuring fairness in the distribution of benefits and competition\nis crucial to maintaining a cooperative and competitive balance.\n• Responsibility: Participants must take responsibility for their actions, con-\ntributing to both collaborative and competitive elements responsibly.\n• Equity: Striving for equity in the outcomes of cooperation and competi-\ntion, considering the diverse interests and capabilities of individuals.\nDifferent Cultures:\n• Transparency: Cultural transparency is essential to bridge understanding\namong participants from different cultural backgrounds, creating a shared\nunderstanding of co-opetitive dynamics.\n• Fairness: Ensuring fairness in cultural representation and acknowledging\ndiverse perspectives in both collaboration and competition.\n• Responsibility: Culturally responsible actions contribute to effective co-\nopetition, respecting the values and norms of diverse cultures.\n• Equity: Addressing cultural disparities and striving for equitable partici-\npation and benefits across diverse cultural groups.\nInstitutions:\n• Transparency: Transparent institutional processes are necessary to estab-\nlish clear rules and guidelines for co-opetition.\n• Fairness: Institutional fairness ensures that rules and policies promote\nequitable opportunities for collaboration and competition.\n• Responsibility: Institutions play a role in enforcing responsible behavior,\nholding participants accountable for their contributions.\n• Equity: Institutional structures should strive for equitable distribution of\nresources and opportunities within co-opetitive frameworks.\nNation:\n• Transparency:\nNational transparency in co-opetitive initiatives fosters\ntrust and understanding among participants from different nations.\n197\n\n• Fairness: Ensuring that national interests are fairly represented and con-\nsidered in co-opetitive dynamics.\n• Responsibility: National responsibility involves promoting ethical behav-\nior and adherence to agreed-upon rules in co-opetition.\n• Equity: Striving for equitable outcomes that benefit participating nations\nand consider their unique circumstances.\nOn and Off-Line Platforms:\n•\n• Transparency: Platforms facilitating co-opetition must be transparent in\ntheir operations, ensuring participants understand the online and offline\ndynamics.\n• Fairness: Ensuring fair representation and opportunities for collaboration\nand competition on digital platforms.\n• Responsibility: Online platforms should encourage responsible behavior,\nemphasizing ethical conduct in co-opetitive interactions.\n• Equity: Addressing digital divides and ensuring equitable access to online\nplatforms for diverse participants.\nGlobally:\n• Transparency: Global transparency is essential for cross-border co-opetition,\nensuring a clear understanding of shared goals and competition.\n• Fairness: Striving for fairness in global representation and acknowledging\nthe diverse interests and contributions of participants worldwide.\n• Responsibility: Global responsibility involves ethical behavior on a global\nscale, promoting positive outcomes in co-opetition.\n• Equity: Addressing global inequalities and promoting equitable participa-\ntion and benefits in co-opetitive scenarios.\nOver Time:\n• Transparency: Transparent communication over time ensures that partic-\nipants are aware of evolving co-opetitive dynamics.\n• Fairness: Adapting co-opetition strategies to changing circumstances while\nensuring fairness in long-term collaborations and competitions.\n• Responsibility: Long-term responsibility involves sustained ethical behav-\nior and commitment to mutual benefits over time.\n• Equity: Ensuring that co-opetition evolves to address changing needs and\nmaintains equitable outcomes over time.\n198\n\nMI deployment and adoption\nThe deployment of MI in Africa is characterized as not only a competition but\nalso a coopetitive Mean-Field-Type Game due to several factors:\n• Cooperative Elements: MI deployment often involves collaboration among\nvarious stakeholders, including governments, private enterprises, and re-\nsearch institutions. Shared initiatives for technology adoption, skill devel-\nopment, and addressing common challenges create cooperative dynamics.\n• Competitive Aspects: Different entities within Africa may compete for\nresources, market dominance, or technological advancements in the MI\nlandscape. This competition can drive innovation, economic growth, and\nthe pursuit of leadership positions in the MI sector.\n• Mean-Field-Type Dynamics: The mean-field-type dynamics in MI deploy-\nment consider not only the actions of individual decision-makers but also\nthe overall distribution of state-action pairs. This reflects the intercon-\nnectedness of MI strategies, where the outcomes depend on collective in-\nteractions rather than isolated decision-making.\n• Risk-Aware and Non-Symmetric Interactions: MI deployment in Africa\ninvolves risk-aware scenarios, acknowledging the uncertainties and chal-\nlenges unique to the continent. The interactions are non-symmetric, con-\nsidering the diverse contexts, economic landscapes, and technological in-\nfrastructures across African nations.\n• Coopetition for Common Goals: While entities may compete in certain\naspects of MI development, there is a recognition that collaboration on\nshared goals, such as addressing socio-economic challenges, improving\nhealthcare, or promoting education, can lead to mutual benefits. Coope-\ntition arises as entities balance competition and cooperation to achieve\noverarching objectives.\n• Partial Altruism and Partial Spite: Entities may exhibit partial altru-\nism by contributing to initiatives that benefit the broader community or\nregion. Simultaneously, there might be elements of partial spite, where\ncompetitive behaviors aim to gain advantages in specific domains. This\nmix of cooperative and competitive motives characterizes the coopetitive\nnature of MI deployment.\n• Interactions Beyond Traditional Competition: The coopetitive Mean-Field-\nType Game considers interactions that go beyond traditional competition.\nIt involves collaborative efforts in areas like research and development,\nstandard-setting, and addressing shared challenges, acknowledging that\ncollective success can drive individual success.\n• Complex Interplay of Actors: The deployment of MI in Africa involves\na complex interplay of various actors, including governments, businesses,\n199\n\nacademia, and communities. The interactions among these diverse stake-\nholders contribute to the coopetitive dynamics, shaping the trajectory of\nMI development on the continent.\nCoopetitive MI in Africa\nThere are over several hundred millions of people in Africa with diverse expe-\nriences in Agriculture, Breeding, Transformation, Trade, Traditional nutrition,\nTradition, and Culture. Some of these Africans are champions in their fields.\nHowever, their innovations remain unknown and are often considered mysteri-\nous due to a language barrier. They are not considered literate in the current\nsystem, even though their audio-rich knowledge based on local experiences holds\ngreat societal value. They are in fact audio-literate, not illiterate.\nTimadie’s Coopetition MI solution aims to place all Africans, particularly\nthose with unique knowledge, at the core of machine intelligence. Despite lan-\nguage barriers, our goal is to create direct audio-to-audio processing using high-\nquality, culture-aware datasets.\nTeams for each local language and bridging\nteams connecting different languages form a coopetitive graph of machine in-\ntelligence, not limited to text, audio, or video. Any knowledge-based learning\nmodel can join and enrich the Coopetition. We aim create value with these\naudio-rich knowledgeable people.\nThe methods are :\nHigh-quality culture-\nsensitive & ethical audio dataset, Blockchainized audio token datasets, Bridge\nto another local language: links. Examples include, but limited to, Tommo-So\nDogon to Kenedougou Senoufo, Fon (from Benin) to Tommo-So Dogon, Audio\ndataset enhancement, Large Audio learning, Audio2Audio translation, Audio\nto visual (image/video) in a local context, Large vision learning, Multimodal\nLarge Learning, etc.\n10\nData in Africa: quality, information, modes\nTo develop an MI system tailored for the diverse needs of African people, acquir-\ning and leveraging high-quality data becomes increasingly pivotal. The success\nand efficacy of MI in Africa are intricately tied to the richness and relevance of\nthe datasets used for training and refining these systems. Gathering comprehen-\nsive and representative data from various regions, groups, ethnicities, languages,\nand socioeconomic backgrounds within the continent is essential to ensure that\nthe resulting MI models are inclusive, unbiased, and culturally sensitive. Copy-\npasting an MI from other cultures and other languages may not be efficient.\nMoreover, high-quality data is not solely about quantity but also about the ac-\ncuracy, authenticity, and real-world applicability of the information collected. It\ninvolves capturing the nuances of daily life, understanding regional contexts, and\nreflecting the dynamic nature of African societies. By prioritizing data quality,\nthe development of local & context-aware MI in Africa can overcome challenges\nrelated to underrepresentation and biases, fostering a technology landscape that\ntruly resonates with the diverse realities of the continent. Additionally, a com-\n200\n\nmitment to ethical data practices is paramount. Safeguarding privacy, ensuring\ninformed consent, and promoting transparency in data collection processes are\nintegral aspects of building an MI infrastructure that aligns with African val-\nues and respects individual rights. Ethical considerations not only enhance the\nreliability of MI applications but also foster trust among users, thereby encour-\naging widespread adoption and acceptance of these technologies. In essence,\nrecognizing the importance of high-quality data is foundational to the success-\nful development and deployment of MI solutions in Africa. It is a collaborative\neffort that involves stakeholders from various sectors working together to curate\ndatasets that authentically represent the continent’s multifaceted landscape, ul-\ntimately paving the way for MI systems that positively impact and empower\nAfrican communities.\n10.1\nAudio-rich languages\nIn most African countries, the local population uses oral languages, producing\naudios, speeches, voices, songs, and mimics, among others. These languages\nare rich in audio content. Unfortunately, up to now, these audio resources have\nnot been fully utilized. A beneficial application of MI for the local population\nin Africa could involve a direct conversion of audio from one oral language to\nanother. As an exercise we took the list of top 10 MI chatbots and asked simple\nquestions local African languages.\nWe have tested with the three following\nquestions:\n• How do you say ’thank you’ in Tommo-So Dogon?\n• Count from 1 to 5 in Tommo-So Dogon\n• How do you say ’what is your name?’ in Tommo-So Dogon ?\nThe answers to these questions were not satisfactory as of December 2023. Then\nwe tested the same 3 questions for 200 African languages.The answers were not\neven close. This simple experience mirrors the situation faced by Africans who\ndon’t speak English. Many language models do not perform well for languages\nwith smaller numbers of speakers, especially African ones. The problem becomes\neven more serious when we have that experience with those who cannot read\nand write but speak very well their mother tongue. Most of these languages are\naudio-rich and currently there is MI adapted to local MI problems: translation\nin audio format from African language to another. Although there have been\nefforts to include certain languages in MI models even when there is not much\ndata available for training, these results show that the technology “really still\nisn’t capturing our languages. This is due to the fact that the available resources\nwhich are audio data are not exploited in these LLMs.\n10.2\nUndefined terms to be clarified for machines\nImagine a super-smart computer with data collected in Africa that can learn\nfrom pictures, words, and sounds all together. Sometimes, this computer can\n201\n\nmake mistakes like believing things that aren’t true (delusion), creating things\nthat seem real but aren’t (illusion), making up stories that sound good but have\nparts that aren’t real (confabulation), and even creating pictures or sounds\nthat are like dreams (hallucination). It might mix up where things came from\n(misattribution) or use words in new ways (semantic drift). It could make things\nsound bigger or more important than they are (exaggeration) and tell stories\nwith fewer details than they need (semantic compression). Sometimes, it can’t\nfigure out what caused what (causal inference failure), and other times it makes\nthings that look almost real but not quite (perceptual uncanny valley).\nSo,\nwhile it’s an amazing computer, it sometimes makes these mistakes that need\nto be defined properly, evaluated and corrected.\nThe book in [3] addresses some of these questions.\nWhile these terms are unclear in MI, they are widely used in the literature\nincluding in Africa. It does not help to clarify and demystify the methods used\nin the building blocks of these MI technologies.\n10.3\nAfrica’s rich audio literacy\nYou want to engage in telemedicine in rural Africa, but face challenges due to lo-\ncal language barriers. Similarly, responding to a village’s call for adult business\neducation and facilitating communication between two farmers with 40 years of\nlocal agricultural experience, who cannot read or write, is hindered by language\nbarriers. According to Statistica, it exceeds 30 percent of the 1.4 billion people\nin Africa. It is clear that an ethical, context-aware and culture-aware audio-\nto-audio MI technique could catalyze the inclusion of 400 millions of people in\nthese scenarios in Africa. In the vast landscape of technological evolution, Africa\nemerges as a reservoir of untapped potential. Defined by multifaceted richness\nacross its 54 countries, the continent boasts a unique strength woven into the\nfabric of its diverse cultures - an inherent proficiency in audio literacy. From\nthe rhythmic beats of traditional music to the oral traditions passed through\ngenerations, audio literacy is an integral part of African societies. This profi-\nciency seamlessly extends into the digital domain, exemplified by the flourishing\nonline audio messaging platforms. We need to explore the transformative power\nof leveraging Africa’s audio literacy as a catalyst for the advancement of MI in\nAfrica. With linguistic diversity and vibrant oral traditions, the continent holds\na reservoir of potential waiting to be tapped. The power of audio presents a\ntransformative opportunity for technological innovation in various forms, includ-\ning sounds, gestures, voices, images, mimics, signs, music, speeches, or videos.\nSeveral individuals in Africa, currently labeled as illiterate by the system, ex-\ntensively use mobile phones to send audio messages to their counterparts, and\nthese counterparts respond in audio in the same local language. This local lan-\nguage audio-to-audio communication has gained unprecedented momentum in\nseveral regions of Africa, generating a multitude of audio data. We realize that\nthese individuals are audio communicators, they are in fact audio literate, cre-\nating hope for inclusion through technology. Unfortunately, as of today, there\nis no technology allowing audio-to-audio communication across different local\n202\n\nlanguages because these languages lack or minimally use conventional writing\nsystems and the current technologies are limited in textless audio processing . It\nis imperative for us to transcend conventional modes of technology engagement\nand explore the possibilities that audio literacy unfurls. This article serves as\na clarion call to stakeholders across the spectrum - policymakers, technologists,\ndevelopers, educators, and innovators - to recognize and harness Africa’s rich\naudio literacy.\nBridging the Tech Divide: Audio Literacy as the Catalyst\nIn a continent rich with diverse cultures and languages, the intersection of MI\nand audio communication is not just a leap into the digital age but a catalyst\nfor positive change. MI leveraging audio literacy is essential in Africa for its\nability to bridge linguistic divides and promote inclusivity. With a multitude\nof languages spoken across the continent, audio-based technology ensures that\ninformation is accessible to a broader audience, transcending literacy barriers.\nThis inclusivity becomes a driving force in education, healthcare, and commu-\nnication, fostering a more connected and empowered society. Additionally, as\noral traditions play a significant role in many African cultures, embracing audio\nliteracy through MI respects and preserves these rich narratives while propelling\ncommunities into a digitally empowered future.\nEmpowering Farmers Through Audio Knowledge Sharing\nImagine a scenario where MI facilitates audio knowledge-sharing among farmers\nin local African languages like Tommo-So Dogon and Fon. In Tommo-So Dogon,\nfarmers could exchange insights on sustainable agricultural practices through\nvoice messages, discussing soil health or effective crop rotation. Simultaneously,\nin Fon, another group of farmers might share audio clips on traditional farming\ntechniques or effective pest control methods. This audio-to-audio knowledge\nexchange not only preserves cultural nuances but also creates a collaborative\nplatform where diverse communities can benefit from each other’s expertise,\nfostering a stronger agricultural network across the continent.\nDeveloping Offline Audio-to-Audio Translation for Farmers\nMI can develop an offline, electricity-independent audio-to-audio translation\ntool for Tommo-So Dogon and Fon, catering to farmers’ specific needs. By in-\ncorporating pre-trained models into portable, low-energy devices, such as solar-\npowered audio devices, farmers can access translations without the internet.\nThese devices could utilize edge computing, processing information locally to\novercome connectivity challenges.\nThis textless translation model would be\ntrained on a diverse dataset of both languages, understanding the unique pho-\nnetics and nuances. This tailored solution empowers farmers with a user-friendly\ntool, ensuring vital knowledge exchange and collaboration, even in remote areas\nwith limited resources.\n203\n\nUnlocking the Potential of African Audio Datasets\nA significant hurdle lies in the underutilization of the massive audio datasets\ngenerated by Africans. Despite the wealth of linguistic diversity and cultural\nknowledge captured in these recordings, current MI implementations often over-\nlook or lack access to these locally sourced datasets. Harnessing and incorpo-\nrating these valuable resources could substantially enhance the accuracy and\neffectiveness of audio-to-audio translation tools, addressing the gap in inclusive\ntechnological solutions tailored to the specific needs of communities speaking\nlanguages like Tommo-So Dogon and Fon. The Imperative of Advanced Audio\nProcessing Tools Moreover, the need to develop advanced audio processing tools\nbecomes evident in leveraging the rich diversity of African languages. Creating\naccurate audio-to-audio translation models demands sophisticated algorithms\nthat can decipher subtle intonations, dialectical variations, and cultural con-\ntext present in these recordings. Investing in the research and development of\ncutting-edge audio processing tools is crucial to unlocking the full potential of\nMI in catering to the unique linguistic landscape of Africa, facilitating effective\nknowledge exchange among farmers in languages like Tommo-So Dogon and\nFon.\nClosing the Technological Gap: Audio-Based MI for Inclusivity\nIn Africa, it’s not the people who are late; it’s the technologies. The richness of\noral traditions and audio literacy among diverse communities is palpable. How-\never, the technology landscape has yet to catch up. Remember, local languages\nare rich in audio, but current technology struggles with audio processing. If\nthe technology transforms audio to text and translates and converts to audio\nthe translated text, it loses most of the interesting nuances since many of these\nlanguages lack a writing system. There’s a need for innovation to enable tech-\nnology to work directly with audio signals, mirroring how local African people\ncommunicate, without relying on text.\nUrgently, we need to bridge this gap by developing Audio-based Machine In-\ntelligence. By harnessing the innate audio literacy of the people, we can create\ninclusive solutions that transcend linguistic barriers. It’s time for technology\nto align with the vibrant mosaic of African cultures and empower communities\nthrough accessible, audio-driven advancements. Rethinking Tech Adoption: An\nUrgent Call for Inclusive MI When we force people to adopt current MI technolo-\ngies, we create a greater tech divide in African society because the audio-literate\nare left out, and they constitute millions of people. However, if an audio-based\nMI exists today, these millions of people could seize the opportunities to use it\nin their businesses, just as they started on audio messaging platforms without\nknowing how to read and write. All tech developers must consider this feedback\nif the goal is to reduce the tech divide.\nIt’s not because a piece of information is not available on the internet that\nthis information doesn’t exist. It’s not because these millions of people don’t\nwrite that their history doesn’t exist. They are audio-literate individuals that\n204\n\ntechnologies must learn from and integrate.\nIn exploring MI in Africa, the\ncontinent’s abundant potential lies in its rich audio literacy. From traditional\nrhythms to dynamic oral traditions, audio literacy is a transformative force.\nThe call to leverage Africa’s audio proficiency for MI resonates as millions,\nlabeled illiterate, actively engage in local language audio-to-audio communica-\ntion through smartphones.\nDespite challenges, the journey toward inclusive\nMI involves recognizing cultural narratives, preserving oral traditions, and ad-\ndressing technological gaps. By embracing audio literacy, we pave the way for\na future where technology aligns with African cultures, empowering communi-\nties through accessible, audio-driven advancements, and reducing technological\ndivides.\nMachine Intelligence Integrity\nMachine intelligence integrity can be understood as the intentional and system-\natic approach to design, implement, and operate machine intelligence systems\nin a manner that upholds safety, dignity, and ethical considerations throughout\ntheir lifecycle. It involves embedding ethical assessments into the core function-\ning of the MI’s operating system, ensuring a continuous commitment to human\nvalues and societal well-being.\nFor lawyers, understanding machine intelligence integrity is crucial as it in-\nvolves legal and ethical compliance, ensuring MI systems adhere to evolving\nregulations and ethical standards. It also underscores the importance of legal\noversight in addressing ethical challenges, safeguarding user rights, and con-\ntributing to the responsible and lawful deployment of MI technologies.\nMachine intelligence integrity is a foundational principle for developers, em-\nphasizing the conscientious and systematic approach to designing, developing,\nand maintaining MI systems with a commitment to ethical considerations and\nhuman values. It involves integrating ethical assessments directly into the core\nof the MI operating system, ensuring that the system not only meets technical\nstandards but also aligns with principles of safety, fairness, and dignity. For\ndevelopers, machine integrity highlights the importance of proactive measures\nduring the entire lifecycle of MI, promoting transparency, user-centric design,\nand continuous monitoring to address potential biases and ethical concerns. By\nembracing machine integrity, developers contribute to building MI systems that\nare not just technically robust but also ethically sound, fostering responsible\ninnovation and positive societal impact.\nMachine intelligence integrity stands as a critical framework for government\nauthorities engaged in regulating and overseeing machine intelligence.\nThis\nconcept underscores the intentional and systematic design, development, and\nongoing operation of MI systems with a focus on ethical considerations and\nalignment with human values. For government authorities, understanding and\npromoting machine integrity means advocating for MI systems that prioritize\nsafety, fairness, and transparency, while also accommodating the evolving eth-\nical landscape. It emphasizes the importance of regulations and oversight to\nensure that MI technologies are deployed responsibly, respecting legal frame-\n205\n\nworks, and contributing positively to societal well-being. By incorporating ma-\nchine integrity into regulatory discussions, government authorities play a crucial\nrole in fostering an ethical and accountable MI ecosystem that serves the public\ninterest.\nMachine Intelligence Integrity goes beyond the standard\nethics\nScope and Focus:\n• Machine Intelligence Integrity: Primarily focuses on the intentional and\nsystematic design and operation of MI systems to ensure safety, dignity,\nand ethical considerations throughout their lifecycle.\n• Multi-Factor MI Ethics Over Time: Encompasses a broader scope, con-\nsidering various ethical factors that may evolve over time, including but\nnot limited to privacy, transparency, bias mitigation, and societal impact.\nTemporal Perspective:\n• Machine Intelligence Integrity: Emphasizes a continuous commitment to\nethical considerations throughout the entire lifespan of the MI system.\n• Multi-Factor MI Ethics Over Time: Acknowledges the dynamic nature of\nethical concerns, recognizing that factors like societal norms and values\ncan evolve, requiring ongoing ethical assessments and adaptations.\nIntegration into Operating Systems:\n• Machine Intelligence Integrity: Involves embedding ethical assessments\ndirectly into the core functioning of the MI’s operating system, making\nethical considerations an integral part of the MI’s behavior.\n• Multi-Factor MI Ethics Over Time: Requires periodic assessments and\nadjustments to ethical guidelines, often influencing MI design and decision-\nmaking processes but may not be as deeply integrated into the operating\nsystem.\nHuman Empowerment Emphasis:\n• Machine Intelligence Integrity: Posits that MI should serve the empower-\nment of humanity, suggesting a focus on designing systems that contribute\npositively to human well-being.\n• Multi-Factor AI Ethics Over Time: Prioritizes ethical guidelines to ensure\nMI benefits humanity and avoids harm, but the emphasis may extend\nbeyond empowerment to encompass a broader set of considerations.\n206\n\nProactive vs. Reactive Approach:\n• Machine Intelligence Integrity: Takes a proactive stance by designing MI\nsystems with integrity from the outset, aiming to prevent ethical issues.\n• Multi-Factor MI Ethics Over Time: May involve a more reactive approach,\nresponding to emerging ethical concerns and adapting guidelines as soci-\netal and technological landscapes evolve.\nComprehensiveness of Ethical Factors:\n• Machine Integrity: Specifically addresses the intentional design and oper-\nation of MI systems to ensure safety, dignity, and ethical considerations.\n• Multi-Factor MI Ethics Over Time: Encompasses a wider range of ethical\nfactors, such as fairness, accountability, and explainability, recognizing\nthe multifaceted nature of ethical considerations in MI development and\ndeployment.\nHow to Implement Machine Intelligence Integrity ?\nImplementing machine integrity involves a comprehensive approach to ensure\nthe ethical design, development, and operation of MI systems throughout their\nlifecycle.\nThis includes defining clear ethical principles aligned with human\nvalues, embedding ethical assessments into the design process, using diverse\nand representative data to minimize biases, implementing transparency and\nexplainability mechanisms, continuous monitoring, user involvement, adaptive\nlearning, human-in-the-loop governance, privacy protection, regular audits, and\nresponsive post-deployment policies. The goal is to proactively address ethical\nconcerns, promote fairness, and safeguard user privacy, fostering a system that\nrespects human values and societal norms.\nMachine Intelligence integrity is a comprehensive framework for ensuring\nthe responsible design, development, and operation of MI systems. It involves\nembedding multi-factor ethical considerations into the core functioning of MI op-\nerating systems, with a focus on upholding safety, fairness, and dignity in align-\nment with human values. Multi-factor ethical adherence is assessed through a\nset of scalar values, each representing the adherence to specific ethical principles,\nwhile decision alignment is similarly evaluated with scalar values for alignment\nto decision principles. The resulting multi-objective metric vector captures the\nnuanced evaluation of both ethical adherence and decision alignment, providing\na holistic measure of machine integrity. This approach enables a dynamic and\nresponsive assessment that considers the evolving nature of ethics and human\nvalues over time, making it a vital concept for fostering responsible MI practices\nacross various domains.\nPart of the errors can be reduced using the following filter:\n207\n\nKnowns\nUnknowns\nBelieve\nas\nKnown\nKnown\nKnowns\nKnown\nUn-\nknowns\nBelief\nas\nUnknown\nUnknown\nKnowns\nUnknown Un-\nknowns\nwhich is rewritten as\nKnowns\nUnknowns\nBelieve\nas\nKnown\nThings\nthe\nMI\nknows it knows\nThings\nthe\nMI\nknows it doesn’t\nknow\nBelief\nas\nUnknown\nThings\nthe\nMI\ndoesn’t\nknow\nit\nknows\nThings\nthe\nMI\ndoesn’t\nknow\nit\ndoesn’t know\nIn dynamic game theory, a state-feedback strategy refers to a decision-\nmaking approach where the actions of a player are determined based on both\nthe current state of the system and the historical evolution of the game. Unlike\nopen-loop strategies that depend solely on the initial conditions, state-feedback\nstrategies enable players to adapt their actions dynamically in response to the\nchanging circumstances within the game. These strategies involve the use of\nfeedback mechanisms, where information about the current state is continu-\nously incorporated to adjust the player’s decisions, allowing for more flexibility\nand responsiveness in complex, evolving dynamic environments.\nIn Mean-Field-Type Game Theory (MFTG), a state-and-mean-field-type\nstrategy involves players making decisions based not only on their individual\nstate-action pairs but also on the distribution of all individual state-action pairs.\nIn this strategy, each player’s action is influenced by both their own local infor-\nmation (state) and own individual mean-field (belief), and the collective behav-\nior local information and local belief of the entire group. The mean-field type\nterm here captures the distribution of own information and the distribution\nof others’ information. It allows to consider risk-aware decisions via variance,\nquantile, expectile, extremile, conditional value-at-risk, entropic value-at-risk,\netc. State-and-mean-field-type feedback strategies are particularly relevant in\nrisk quantification in engineering.\nA state-and-mean-field-type feedback strategy can be defined as a measur-\nable function incorporating various factors to assess the integrity of machine\nintelligence. The measurable function is a result of:\n(a) Current time\n(b) Current high-quality data\n(c) Current extracted knowledge data\n(d) Current architecture design\n(e) Current training model\n(f) Current localized deployment model\n(g) Current privacy-preserving status\n(h)Current context-awareness\n(i) Current risk-awareness\n(j) Current localized culture-awareness\n208\n\n(k) States of the societies at the current time\n(l) Localized social norms of the societies at the corresponding states\n(m) Current beliefs about human values\nA state-and-mean-field-type feedback strategy for implementing machine in-\ntelligence integrity involves creating a measurable function that considers factors\nsuch as initial and current quality data, time, knowledge, architecture design,\ntraining and deployment models, societal states, beliefs about human values,\nand cultural influences. This approach requires continuous monitoring, adap-\ntive learning, feedback loops, scenario planning, ethics committees, human-in-\nthe-loop governance, privacy protection, regular audits, user involvement, and\neducational initiatives.\nBy integrating these elements, the strategy aims to\nproactively align the machine intelligence system with evolving ethical consider-\nations, human values, and societal norms, fostering responsible and accountable\ndeployment throughout its lifecycle. The advantage of employing a state-and-\nmean-field-type feedback strategy in Machine Intelligence lies in its comprehen-\nsive and adaptive approach to managing complex, interconnected factors. This\nstrategy allows the system to continuously monitor and integrate various ele-\nments such as initial and current data quality, temporal aspects, architectural\ndesign, societal states, beliefs about human values, and cultural influences. By\nincorporating a mean-field-type approach, which considers the influence of the\ncollective distribution of these factors, the system becomes more responsive to\nevolving ethical considerations and societal dynamics. This adaptability, cou-\npled with proactive measures like scenario planning, regular audits, and user\ninvolvement, enhances the system’s ability to align with human values, address\nbiases, and promote responsible innovation. Ultimately, the state-and-mean-\nfield-type feedback strategy contributes to the development of machine intel-\nligence systems that are not only technically robust but also ethically sound,\nfostering trust and positive societal impact\nAdaptive Machine Integrity\nAdapting machine integrity to the evolution of ethics and human values involves\na proactive and dynamic approach. Continuous ethical assessment, feedback\nmechanisms, and engagement with diverse stakeholders are essential for staying\naligned with changing societal perspectives. Keeping training data updated,\nforming ethics committees, and implementing scenario planning contribute to\nanticipating and addressing emerging ethical challenges. Utilizing version con-\ntrol for iterative updates, ensuring legal and regulatory compliance, fostering\npublic discourse, and maintaining human oversight are crucial components in\nthe ongoing effort to navigate and integrate evolving ethical considerations into\nMI systems. Education and awareness initiatives further support a collective\ncommitment to upholding machine integrity in the face of shifting ethical land-\nscapes over time.\n209\n\n11\nConclusion\nThis survey article sheds light on the state of MI research and implementation\nin Africa. It underscores the diverse paths each country takes in embracing\nMI and other emerging technologies.\nThe table highlighting countries with\nexplicit national MI strategies reflects a growing governmental awareness and\ncommitment in some regions. However, the article reveals a disparity between\nhigh-profile meetings held in luxurious venues and the actual impact on the\nlocal population, emphasizing the need for inclusive strategies. Moreover, the\nexamination of over 400 research articles highlights the prevalence of overselling\nfindings and the importance of updating studies to practical MI algorithms.\nThe ethical dimension emerges in the call to move beyond uniform rankings,\nconsidering factors like data transparency and concrete government actions for\na more accurate assessment of the progress achieved by MI and its utilization\nacross the continent. Ultimately, this survey article serves as a valuable resource\nfor understanding the landscape of MI in Africa and advocating for meaningful,\nlocally impactful advancements.\nFuture work\nOur review of 400 articles in MI in Africa from 2018-2023 show the use of these\ntechnologies in diverse settings. From Cabo Verde to the tip of Ethiopia, from\nCape Town to Tunis via Madagascar, the informal sector appears to extensively\nharness machine intelligence.\n• In the future, local MI must assimilate this on-the-ground data to enhance\nits knowledge, covering a significant portion of the informal sector.\n• The ability to learn audibly from one local language to another without\nrelying on a writing system opens up business opportunities for millions\nof people who excel in their native languages despite being unable to read\nor write.\n• The multidimensional and multifactorial aspect of machine ethics, influ-\nenced by local culture and specific issues, should not be overlooked and\nmust be integrated from the design and algorithm training and learning\nphase.\n• Local MI capable of operating without internet or electricity could broaden\naccess in rural areas, benefiting both the young and the elderly.\n• Developing strategic MI in underserved areas would help anticipate market\ninteractions and the informal economy.\n• Quantifying the risks associated with strategic MI should be at the core\nof design, taking into account ethical and cultural factors.\n210\n\nExamining closely 400 articles on MI in Africa, beyond the headlines, it\nemerges that\n• human learning, the learning of men and women, whether children or\nadults, takes a much more central place in discussions than machine learn-\ning.\n• At the core is human learning, utilizing various tools, including machine\nassistance, as well as inspiration from nature.\nEarly stage MI development topics\nBelow we provide some selected topics and their early stage MI development in\nAfrican countries.\nMI Implementation for African Countries\nRealization\nBlockchain and MI-enabled National ID\nVery Early Stage\nBlockchain and MI-enabled Land Management\nVery Early Stage\nAudio2Audio local languages\nVery Early Stage\nText2Image local items\nVery Early Stage\nImage2Audio local languages\nVery Early Stage\nKnowledge-based MI\nVery Early Stage\nRobust MI Infrastructure\nVery Early Stage\nMI-enabled Cybersecurity\nVery Early Stage\nAccessible MI Education Programs\nVery Early Stage\nCollaborative MI Research Initiatives\nVery Early Stage\nResponsible MI Policies and Regulations\nVery Early Stage\nSector-wide Integration of MI Technologies\nVery Early Stage\nSupportive Ecosystem for MI Startups\nVery Early Stage\nTechnical MI Ethics\nVery Early Stage\nNon-Technical MI Ethics\nVery Early Stage\nEthical Considerations in MI Development\nVery Early Stage\nData Accessibility, Privacy, and Security\nVery Early Stage\nGovernment Investment in MI Initiatives\nVery Early Stage\nGlobal Participation in MI Initiatives\nVery Early Stage\nEthical Data Practices\nVery Early Stage\nInclusive MI Integration Across Key Sectors\nVery Early Stage\nInternational Partnerships for Knowledge Exchange\nVery Early Stage\nFunding for MI Research and Development\nVery Early Stage\nEmphasis on Responsible and Inclusive MI Practices\nVery Early Stage\nPromotion of MI Education and Skilled Workforce\nVery Early Stage\nDevelopment of MI Regulatory Frameworks\nVery Early Stage\nStrategic MI Technology Integration in Key Sectors\nVery Early Stage\nSupport for MI Startup Ecosystem\nVery Early Stage\nPublic Awareness and Understanding of MI\nVery Early Stage\nMI-driven Solutions for Socio-Economic Challenges\nVery Early Stage\nInfrastructure for Advanced Data Analytics\nVery Early Stage\nMI-driven Agricultural Innovations\nVery Early Stage\nTelemedicine and Healthcare MI Applications\nVery Early Stage\nMI in Renewable Energy\nVery Early Stage\nMI in Environmental Conservation\nVery Early Stage\nMI for Efficient Transportation and Logistics\nVery Early Stage\nMI for Cities and Urban Planning\nVery Early Stage\nMI in Education for Personalized Learning\nVery Early Stage\nCommunity Engagement in MI Development\nVery Early Stage\nMI for Disaster Response and Management\nVery Early Stage\nMI-powered Financial Inclusion Initiatives\nVery Early Stage\nTable 62: MI Implementation Topics for the Benefits of African Countries\nConcrete actions for MI implementations\nImplementing MI as a local public good for the population requires collabo-\nration among traditional authorities, government bodies, educational institu-\ntions, industry stakeholders, and local communities. It cannot be reduced to\na political announcement without any concrete followup. Regular assessments,\ntransparency, and a commitment to inclusivity will contribute to the success-\nful development of responsible and culture-aware MI for the benefit of African\n211\n\nsocieties and worldwide. Here are some concrete actions to be taken towards\nimplementation:\n• Recommendation:\nDevelop training programs for MI practitioners on\nethics and cultural sensitivity, catering to all Africans, including those\nwho may be considered illiterate but are, in fact, highly aural literate.\nThe equivalent of literacy for audio is often referred to as ”aural literacy”\nor ”audio literacy.” Aural literacy involves the ability to interpret, compre-\nhend, and create meaning from auditory information. This includes skills\nsuch as listening comprehension, recognizing and understanding various\naudio elements, and effectively using and producing audio content. As\nour interactions with technology and media become more audio-centric,\ndeveloping aural literacy becomes increasingly important for navigating\nand understanding the information presented in audio formats.\n– Concrete Action: Integrate culture-aware ethical training modules\ninto audio literacy MI courses and provide ongoing professional de-\nvelopment opportunities for practitioners.\n• Recommendation: Invest in MI education programs at all educational\nlevels.\n– Concrete Action: Establish MI curriculum in both conventional and\nnon-conventional schools and universities, ensuring

interplay between MI and the rich, diverse cultures of the African con-\ntinent. In our journey through North Africa, Southern Africa, Middle Africa,\nWest Africa, and East Africa, we’ve witnessed the transformative power of MI,\ntranscending geographical boundaries to leave an indelible mark on the informal\neconomy, agriculture, art and music, and societies. Yet, embedded within these\nadvancements is a constant reminder of the importance of cultural sensitivity,\nethical considerations, and the need to harness the unique strengths of Africa’s\naudio literacy. The call to action resonates even more strongly now - the im-\nperative to leverage Africa’s audio literacy as a cornerstone for MI innovation.\nIn the era of digital communication, where the auditory sense is increasingly\nbecoming a dominant mode of interaction, the significance of audio literacy\n217\n\ncannot be overstated. This article extends a resounding call to the global tech\ncommunity, urging a collective acknowledgment and appreciation for the power\nof audio in shaping our technological landscape. The African experience, with\nits innate proficiency in audio literacy, serves as an inspiring model for the\nworld. The fusion of MI and audio literacy has the potential to break down\nbarriers, foster inclusivity, and create technologies that resonate with people on\na deeper, more human level. To the tech innovators, developers, and engineers\nworldwide, consider this an invitation to reevaluate the role of audio in your cre-\nations. Imagine a future where technology not only speaks to users but engages\nwith them in a language that transcends written words - a language embedded\nin the rhythms, intonations, and nuances of audio. As we champion the cause of\naudio literacy, let us embark on a journey to make technology more accessible,\ninclusive, and culturally sensitive. Whether you’re designing virtual assistants,\neducational tools, or entertainment platforms, integrating audio literacy into the\nfabric of your innovations can pave the way for a more universally understood\nand appreciated technological landscape. This is a call to infuse cultural rich-\nness into the very code and algorithms that shape our digital experiences. Let\naudio become a bridge that connects diverse communities, ensuring that tech-\nnology resonates with people from various linguistic and cultural backgrounds.\nIn the spirit of coopetition, where collaboration coexists with competition, let\nus share insights, methodologies, and best practices for incorporating audio lit-\neracy into tech solutions. By doing so, we can collectively contribute to a global\ntechnological ecosystem that celebrates the richness of human expression in all\nits auditory dimensions. This article is also an invitation to envision a future\nwhere the dialogue between humans and machines extends beyond the visual\nand written to embrace the profound power of sound. The path ahead is one of\ncollaboration, innovation, and a shared commitment to shaping a technological\nfuture that is not just intelligent but also deeply attuned to the audio path of\nhumanity.\nAcknowledgment\nThe work of Hamidou Tembine is supported by Timadie grant on Mean-Field-\nType Game Theory for Machine Intelligence in Underserved Areas.\nReferences\n[1] Jean Epstein, l’intelligence d’une machine, les classiques, Publisher: Le\nEditions Jacques Melot, 1946.\n[2] Epstein, J.
